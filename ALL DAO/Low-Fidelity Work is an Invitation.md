### **Low-Fidelity Work is an Invitation**

Building in public is naturally daunting. What if the unfinished thing you show turns people off? What if it makes them think your DAO is a joke? What if it leads them to believe you're an amateur?

However, when building a DAO, I firmly believe there is no alternative. You just have to be willing to look foolish sometimes. If it helps comfort you, there are few DAO experts, so most people are fumbling around in the dark trying to find the light.

But building in public and showcasing low-fidelity work has a huge advantage. The more unfinished things you show, the more likely community members are to want to help. If we present a perfectly designed process map to the community, they’ll feel like the work is done and give us a pat on the back. However, if we show that same process on sticky notes or as hand-drawn sketches, we’ll receive feedback and actionable ideas.

This was the guiding idea behind creating our website, [superteam.fun](https://superteam.fun/), a rough Notion page. We could have easily paid a designer to create something beautiful and polished. **But that would give the impression that the DAO was built, rather than _being_ built.**

During my few weeks in the DAO, I’ve been amazed at how many smart people just want to contribute. Even in the absence of large financial rewards, they simply want to build cool stuff. The more unfinished work you can give them—and the more you make them feel that _all_ the work is unfinished—the more they will build cool stuff.

### **It's More Fun Than Expected**

Despite all the painful mistakes, late nights, and contentious debates we've had in the early days of this DAO, it has easily been the most fun I've had in years. I wake up every morning excited and finish each day surprised.

If you're considering getting involved or starting a DAO, I highly recommend it. And if you have questions or ideas to share, reach out to me on Twitter [@kashdhanda](https://twitter.com/kashdhanda)—I’d love to chat.
