There are many ways to set up a DAO, but here is the basic process:

1. **Get $ETH**: Note that youâ€™ll need at least 0.2 $ETH to set up an Aragon DAO.

2. **Send Your $ETH to Your Web3 Wallet**.

3. Once the $ETH has arrived, go to [https://client.aragon.org/](https://client.aragon.org/), click on Connect Account, and select your wallet provider from the options. Click through the approval process until your wallet is connected.

4. Click "Create an Organization" and follow the instructions to set up your DAO.

Your experience in a DAO will depend on a few factors. First, the type of DAO you join will significantly impact your experience. Joining a developer-focused DAO like [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote) will be very different from joining a more socially-oriented DAO like [Friends With Benefits](https://www.fwb.help/).
