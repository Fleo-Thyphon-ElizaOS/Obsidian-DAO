#DAO 

What could this look like in an organization that’s more physical than digital, in an industry setting, for instance? That’s what Aragon technology, briefly mentioned in 1.3.4, proposes to explore with its project, offering a new way to manage businesses and projects using the benefits of the Ethereum blockchain.

The Aragon platform provides an application to create DAO templates.

### Ready-to-Use

The application allows users to manage funds and votes for an association using a multi-signature wallet without writing a single line of code, blocking an action until all required signatures are gathered. This can be very useful for forcing various stakeholders within a company to reach a common agreement. DAOs programmable with Aragon also enable a range of customizable actions based on the company’s needs: adding or removing participants, assigning tokens that grant voting rights, setting governance parameters (e.g., the percentage of votes needed to pass an action), managing member entries and exits or project finances by vote, creating a decentralized organization with a domain name on the Ethereum blockchain, and more.

Using Aragon brings total transparency to processes, auditable by every member of the company, along with censorship-resistant tools (Ethereum smart contracts). To understand how it works, let’s examine the interface for creating a DAO:

The application first prompts users to choose between programming a project with flexible governance rules (more democratic) or simple multi-signature governance rules, which may be more autocratic if these signatures are assigned to certain higher-ranking individuals. Then, users can define the governance system parameters and set the governance token name for the new organization.

In a project with flexible governance rules, and thus democratic, “Support” and “Minimum Quorum” are parameters necessary to validate votes within the organization. Quorum is the minimum number of members required to hold a valid meeting. If this number is not reached, no decision can be made. The settings specify the required percentage of “Yes” votes and the proportion of tokens participating in the vote to validate a collective decision. This approach allows for highly collective decision-making.

For a project with simple multi-signature governance rules, the process is the same, except with a “Token Manager,” where each participant has one share, giving equal weight in decisions and votes. Participants are predefined. The following steps allow users to adjust the number of tokens and add participants, creating the desired number of tokens and assigning them according to the organization’s preferred voting distribution.

Aragon thus enables the creation of an organization where all decisions can be put to a vote before validation. Depending on the settings, even adding new members may require a vote. Each participant can click on “View Vote” to see their peers’ votes. Each vote requires a percentage and quorum for approval. This system creates an organization where different actors have voting rights, more or less powerful depending on the pre-set parameters. A finance tab also allows for similar management of the organization’s funds, granting limited or full voting rights to various members.

The “Permission” tab offers setup options, enabling users to see at a glance who has execution permissions for various actions, create complex actions that can be scheduled and executed immediately or later, manage parameters, managers, and perform actions related to voting, token management, and project finances.

Finally, the Apps tab provides access to applications specifically developed to automate various processes. For example, “Payroll” helps manage regular payments like salaries, while “Planning Tab” enables automation of HR services. Sensitive data can even be encrypted to ensure visibility for certain users only, and users can delegate their vote using a liquid democracy system if they’re unsure how to vote. These automations promise a significant reduction in administrative transaction costs.
