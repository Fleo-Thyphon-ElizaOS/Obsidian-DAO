# **Trust Funds**

Trust funds have traditionally been reserved for those with the resources to establish and manage complex legal structures. Now, however, DAOs can function as virtual trust funds that require only an Ethereum address to set up. Such easy access opens the doors of finance to younger generations who have not had the same opportunities or savings habits as older generations. Additionally, the higher returns of DeFi should help them capture a fairer share of societyâ€™s total investable assets.

Trust funds are not just for parents looking to set money aside for their children: Twitch gamers or YouTube stars can have full-fledged careers before even reaching puberty, so children protecting their own wealth will increasingly normalize the use of DAOs. The same questions of who to grant admin rights to will still apply in the virtual world as in traditional finance, but in case of dispute, arbitration is much faster and cheaper on a platform like [Aragon Court](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://court.aragon.org/) than any comparable family law case.
