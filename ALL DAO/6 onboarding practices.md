When someone shows up for work and finds ten strangers hanging out in their (virtual) office, how would they feel? Excited? Terrified? Like it’s time to find a new job?

More seriously, in the new world of DAOs, organizational boundaries are becoming permeable, and contributors can emerge from anywhere. How do DAOs manage the influx of interest from the dynamic crypto community and beyond? The process of onboarding new members requires investment and thoughtful design. When done well, it can lay the groundwork for a sustainable and scalable community. Conversely, when onboarding is poorly implemented, a DAO can quickly collapse due to a lack of context, coordination, and focus.

DAO Masters aimed to capture the progress made by DAOs in terms of onboarding and to share insights with the broader Web3 community. The purpose of this report is not to critique the status quo based on what a DAO should or shouldn’t be, but rather to share observations on how these DAOs onboard their members.

Interviews were conducted with key contributors leading onboarding and community-building experiences in DAOs with strong social and cultural components:

Conversations focused on understanding:

1. The onboarding experience for new members
2. The relationship between onboarding a new member and integrating a contributor

While each of these DAOs is unique (each has its own tech stack, and some are tokenized or application-based while others are not), commonalities exist in their approach to onboarding. After compiling, transcribing, and analyzing the interviews, insights were grouped into six key takeaways for community-focused DAO onboarding practices.

## Learnings

### TL;DR

1. Establish a clear mission and vision for the DAO
2. Design the onboarding of new members with contributors in mind
3. Facilitate 1:1 connections, especially at the beginning
4. Invest in education and resources
5. Adapt to varying levels of knowledge and experience
6. Anticipate scalability challenges, particularly concerning work quality and "decentralization"

### 1. Establish a Clear Mission and Vision for the DAO

_"If you know what you want to accomplish, then you know the kind of people you want to onboard." - [Lucas Pontes](https://twitter.com/lucasponn), [Fingerprints DAO](https://twitter.com/FingerprintsDAO)_

Articulating the purpose of the DAO in an exciting and engaging manner is crucial for attracting new community members. Those joining the DAO must clearly understand what it aims to accomplish and how they can fit within that primary objective.

Recently, new DAOs have emerged daily; according to DeepDAO, there are at least [1.7 million DAO members and tokenholders](https://deepdao.io/#/deepdao/dashboard). Someone wanting to get involved with DAOs may try to join and contribute to as many communities as possible; however, this strategy can quickly become overwhelming, diminishing the value they derive from each DAO. A clear mission and vision allow potential new members to quickly determine which DAOs align with their interests and which they are most enthusiastic about joining.

This clarity is also beneficial for DAOs seeking members and contributors— a clear objective attracts individuals who fit well within the community while filtering out those who do not. This is particularly important in a bullish market, where a popular reason for joining DAOs is token speculation.

Communicating a common goal helps set expectations for participation and fosters organizational health. **Instead of trying to be everything for everyone, a DAO must understand what motivates its community and serve that community well in alignment with its mission.** This foundational step lays the groundwork for a strong community ethos, facilitating natural growth. The initial wave of community members, if passionate about the DAO’s mission and vision, will help evolve and grow the community beyond the founders and initial key contributors.

### 2. Design the Onboarding of New Members with Contributors in Mind

_"It is important to have a consistent vehicle for reputation; having that tied to a real name is less important." - [Jon Hillis](https://twitter.com/JonathanHillis), [Creator Cabins DAO](https://twitter.com/creatorcabins)_

This may seem straightforward, but the design of the new member onboarding process greatly influences the integration of contributors. Almost all DAO contributors have been new members at some point! What does it mean to chart a path for new members to eventually become active contributors? Should every new member be expected to contribute in some way? What constitutes too large a DAO in terms of size?

The DAOs consulted approached these questions differently. Some viewed this path in a linear fashion: new members join, begin contributing with a working group, and follow increasing levels of depth with established tasks and units of work. Others see the process as a tree, where there are multiple ways to contribute through various working groups with different levels of involvement.

Regardless of the exact structure, many agree that:

1. Ways to contribute must be clear to all members
2. Contribution expectations should be clearly communicated
3. There should be low-stakes ways to contribute

Many of these DAOs find that numerous individuals are interested in stepping up and contributing, but they don’t know how or where— this is both an educational and an alignment issue. Potential solutions to this problem may include designating specific working groups or project area representatives as known points of contact for potential contributors and providing updates on working groups or projects during public meetings and town halls. Transparency helps remove barriers for those eager to contribute.

Additionally, many DAOs have found that engaged and active contributors who end up in formal contributor roles are often those who have spent time in specific working groups or areas of the DAO beforehand, albeit without a formal contributor role. These individuals have identified their niche _within_ the DAO after joining and have established a reputation as someone who knows what’s going on and can already be a reliable contributor. The path to becoming a highly involved contributor can and should include those who are pseudonymous.

**While there are many implementation options, it is recommended to design the onboarding process to be clear, transparent, and accessible to all new members.**

### 3. Facilitate 1:1 Connections, Especially at the Beginning

_"For social DAOs in particular, 1:1 connections are really important. It helps new members feel comfortable with the community they are joining." - [Nichanan Kesonpat](https://twitter.com/nichanank), [Meta Gamma Delta](https://twitter.com/metagammadelta)_

Joining a DAO can be overwhelming; a constant struggle for DAOs attracting new members is providing context around who is doing what. A direct 1:1 conversation with an existing team member offers new members space to ask questions, share their interests, and discuss what involvement would entail. This tailored onboarding is particularly useful for new members who feel more comfortable in smaller, more intimate environments.

1:1 connections are also beneficial for the DAO. They help ensure that new members are aligned with the DAO's purpose and create a cohesion factor for member retention and engagement. Furthermore, DAO initiators gain a better understanding of who might be the best contributors to specific projects.

Conducting a 1:1 call with each new member is manual and difficult to scale effectively, but it is a worthwhile investment in the community. **It allows context and culture to diffuse from key contributors to other active members of the DAO.** Over time, this can evolve into a peer-to-peer process as more members understand what’s happening.

As these DAOs grow, they adopt different approaches to scale these 1:1 conversations:

- _Mentor/buddy system:_ Each new member is paired with an active member of the community
- _Cohort-based onboarding:_ Each new cohort becomes part of a "class" and completes projects or tasks together as a bonding exercise
- _Task checklists:_ Each new member must complete a small checklist of tasks (e.g., introduce themselves, join a community call, complete a bounty, and/or message a key contributor)

These are just examples of onboarding as a method for creating a support network for new members. Once a DAO reaches a size where everyone doesn’t know everyone, it is crucial for new members to find their niche regarding interests and others.

These may not be the fastest ways to initially grow a community, but it is believed that the resulting community retention in terms of cultural fit and engagement is worthwhile ("high fit with member purpose").

### 4. Invest in Education and Resources

_"Have a wiki or a map of the space, create a chart. Having more resources that people can access is really important." - [Nicole D'Avis](https://twitter.com/mybellalogica), [Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq)_

Many DAOs tend to move extremely quickly. New people, projects, structures, and tools surface at a rapid pace. Adequate documentation of knowledge and processes can help new members navigate the community, understand how to get involved, and stay engaged. These resources are particularly useful when provided alongside programming for new members.

Members need to stay informed and updated on important and relevant information. However, it is up to the DAO to ensure that this process is as smooth as possible. Depending on the DAO's structure, it can facilitate this by identifying the right cadence for sharing information, both synchronously (recurring calls) and asynchronously (messaging, recordings, meeting notes, etc.). This not only fosters collaboration and communication between teams within the DAOs but also facilitates governance efforts.

For DAOs that are tokenized, it is essential to determine appropriate access levels to certain groups and channels. Not all new members need to have write access or a formal path to contribute to the DAO, but **making the DAO's progress visible and transparent can inspire and increase overall engagement.**

### 5. Adapt to Different Levels of Knowledge and Experience

_"We attract a lot of people for whom this is their first point of contact with Web3 and crypto." - Mario [Lopes](https://twitter.com/MrMarioLopes), [KrauseHouse DAO](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO)_

Every person joining a DAO will have different levels of Web3 knowledge, contributive experience, and comfort levels. A clear mission and vision can help attract individuals at similar levels, but ultimately, onboarding processes must account for the differences among these new members (in terms of the target audience for the DAO).

It is crucial to be intentional with the details here: what type of language and terminology is used to introduce new members to the DAO? How many steps are in the onboarding process, and do they involve Discord bots or wallet transactions? How does the onboarding process accommodate someone with limited time or prior interest, versus someone who is more engaged?

A process that includes individuals coming in with varying levels of knowledge and experience is also one that will open up different paths for contribution and engagement based on the unique skills, interests, and availability of each individual. Availability is particularly important to keep in mind, as many DAO members and contributors split their time between multiple communities. DAOs should enable exploration and cross-pollination of ideas and people across projects and communities. In doing so, they can attract and create diverse communities that draw on the unique backgrounds and experiences of individuals.

### 6. Anticipate Scalability Challenges, Particularly Regarding Work Quality and "Decentralization"

_"The consequences are very unpredictable. We are all guinea pigs—it might work, it might not work. We’re all learning together." - [Jay](https://twitter.com/Jayislate), [Forefront](https://twitter.com/forefront)_

As DAOs grow, coordination challenges begin to emerge. When many members are working on different projects and initiatives, who ensures that the quality of work meets the DAO's mission and ethical standards?

It’s a common saying that anyone should be able to contribute in whatever way they wish, but this flexibility and absence of permission must be guided by some form of structure to ensure internal alignment and operational efficiency. Because the communities considered to be DAOs always have people at their center, this structure will be more human than mechanical.

**Structure is particularly important in cases where members do not follow community guidelines or are not aligned with the DAO’s mission and operations.** Key contributors rely on guardrails to "offboard" members in such cases, and they have shared that it is easier to do so when these guardrails are created and implemented from the outset. Without them, decentralization only becomes more difficult as the community evolves, leading to suboptimal resolutions.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, DAOs are organizations. As with any organization, there must be a strategy and process in place to know how people join a DAO, learn about it, and use resources to achieve certain objectives.

Web3 as a whole is evolving very rapidly, and DAOs are no exception. Insights were sought from some of the brightest minds in the DAO space to discover best practices for onboarding. While these DAOs continually improve their processes, patterns have already emerged. These six takeaways aim to assist in creating a solid onboarding experience for a DAO.
