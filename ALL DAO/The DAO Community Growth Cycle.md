In his recent essay, “[Growing a Tokenized Community](https://club.mirror.xyz/hUCOZNvJ7uQI7DXOAmz3Rr-yt82o9gTiJx5T5srD5tc),” [Louis Albiverse](https://twitter.com/albiverse) developed a framework called “The DAO Community Growth Cycle,” where he argues that to grow a DAO, community leaders must attract, recruit, and ultimately engage potential contributors. While this model is very insightful, I believe a fourth step should be added to this growth cycle: retention.

Indeed, crypto is currently a 100% employee market. There are more job openings than good candidates. It is already extremely difficult to [attract high-quality talent](https://coinvise.substack.com/p/how-to-attract-high-quality-talent) into your DAO, but it may be even more complicated to engage them long-term.

DAOs are different from traditional businesses. DAOs enable fluid collaboration and offer flexibility. But the fluid nature of DAOs also makes it challenging to maintain consistent talent that has a significant impact on the DAO. Furthermore, this fluid work nature carries the risk that the most active contributors may become frustrated by the level of engagement of the less active ones.

That is why today, contributor retention is one of the most critical metrics for a DAO, and one of the most urgent issues that these new decentralized organizations must tackle. Growth, scaling, and mass adoption will only follow if DAOs solve the current problem of contributor engagement. By addressing this issue, more DAOs will thrive through their long-term contributors, making their community more attractive to outsiders in crypto, attracting more new contributors, and reinforcing this positive feedback loop.

The million-dollar question now is: how can DAO leaders retain their top contributors and create a community strong enough to keep them engaged long-term? How can they leverage the new tools at their disposal to solve this problem? How can the paradigm shift in the way individuals collaborate in DAOs be a strength rather than a weakness?

This essay will explore how culture, tools, and ownership could be the perfect recipe for high retention in a DAO.

## 1 – What Do Contributors Want?

Many researchers have conducted studies to investigate retention, productivity, and supportive cultures in traditional organizations over the past few years. The key insights and models that organizational psychologists have developed can provide good insight into the essentials of a great DAO.

While there are many ways to positively contribute to employee well-being, three specific elements seem to have a consistently strong influence on employee retention in an organization:

- **CULTURE** – The organization can create a strong culture and share a long-term vision and values with contributors.

- **TOOLS FOR SUCCESS** – The organization can provide contributors with the tools they need and facilitate collaboration.

- **AUTONOMY / OWNERSHIP** – The organization gives contributors enough flexibility and ownership of projects.

Let’s delve deeper into each of these three elements.

### 1.1 – Tell Me What’s Expected of Me… (Culture).

A recent [study](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/great-attrition-or-great-attraction-the-choice-is-yours?cid=soc-web) by McKinsey shows two reasons why employees in traditional companies leave: a lack of a sense of belonging at work (51%) and the lack of feeling that their work is valued by the organization (54%). In short, to retain employees, give them a sense of purpose and community.

And this is exactly what DAOs and the Web3 ecosystem can provide.

Traditional businesses have long tried to create a strong culture and foster belonging. But the primary purpose of a business, by definition, is to make a profit. Culture often serves as a secondary layer in support of profitability and acquiring new market share.

On the other hand, DAOs are primarily virtual places where people passionate about the same things decide to join forces to meet and achieve ambitious goals. It’s not about work. It’s primarily about culture, vibing together, and creating, with others, what you’ve always wanted to create. In DAOs, culture comes first, products and projects come second. Not the other way around.

Due to their intrinsic structure, because by design DAOs lack the traditional hierarchy of a physical organization, they focus on providing support through the culture and goals they uphold.

The most successful DAOs have all created a strong culture through five key elements:

- **They Share a Common Vision with Their Contributors** – Community leaders must find that theme on which people align and that brings people together in their community. They must then articulate a strong vision around that common passion and clearly share this vision with community members. By creating a place where people with common interests can come to find their tribe, learn, and grow together around a shared vision, you ensure that you create the foundation for a great culture.

- **They Provide Ownership to Their Contributors** – These successful DAOs have made their contributors feel responsible for the success of the project and the culture. By giving them ownership, they ensured that they attracted the best talent and achieved good retention of their top contributors.

- **They Know Their Community** – Successful DAOs have deeply understood their typical “community member persona” and created relevant experiences that suit them. Understanding what type of profile the DAOs have in their community allows them to more easily design incentives, develop values, and create specific events and group discussions.

- **They Create Trust** – Building a strong culture is also about creating trust. It is important to foster trust among members but also with people outside the community. To create this trust, having a public face behind the project has proven effective. Another good practice is to hire a scribe to facilitate communication between teams.

- **They Have Strong Values** – The clearer they are about what they want to achieve and their values, the easier it is for them to incentivize people to work with them. People will only contribute long-term if they intrinsically believe in the project and share the same values.

These five elements have proven effective in harnessing the cultural energy of DAOs and help DAOs retain their most valuable contributors.

But creating a great culture is just the first element of better employee retention. Without the right tools and enough flexibility, it will not be enough to keep active community members.

### 1.2 – …And Give Me What I Need to Meet Those Expectations… (Tools for Success).

For contributors to continue working for a DAO, they must have the right tools to do excellent work.

Fortunately, social tokens, the virtual currencies powering DAOs, have the significant advantage of facilitating coordination among contributors through a wide range of tools. Indeed, many new tools allow community leaders to manage their contributors' daily needs and leverage the power of social tokens to make the entire process simple and reliable.

By leveraging cryptographic mechanisms, many actions can now be taken “on-chain,” meaning secured on a blockchain, streamlining the entire process.

One example of these tools that simplify the lives of DAO contributors is the "multi-signature wallet." A multi-signature wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that allows you to manage your community's crypto assets, with the ability to require a predefined number of signatures to confirm transactions. It is necessary to have several team members to ensure that each transaction is executed, which prevents unauthorized access to the funds in this wallet. No one can walk away with all the money since that would require the approval of all other members. It gives ownership to contributors and an open view of the DAO's treasury.

But this is not the only new tool that can truly simplify the daily life of contributors. While it was complicated, for example, for leaders of traditional companies to reliably vote their employees on future strategic decisions for the company, there are now solutions such as Snapshot. [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) is a platform that allows DAO leaders to easily set up governance power, giving the ability to vote on proposals to certain people only.

There is a vast ecosystem of [DAO tools](https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/organization-legos-the-state-of-dao-tooling-866b6879e93e), and to retain high-value community members, it seems essential to explore and implement those that make the most sense for your community.

Communication tools such as Discord, Telegram, or Geneva are indispensable. Indeed, [research](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/help-your-employees-find-purpose-or-watch-them-leave) by McKinsey suggests that public meetings and immersive small group sessions are effective for helping employees align their daily work with the broader mission of the organization. DAOs face this asynchronous communication challenge even more than traditional businesses. In DAOs, contributors are often spread across the globe, and most do not work full-time for the DAO. To avoid this lack of communication, it is important to carefully consider the channels to create in Discord, establish weekly meetings, hire a scribe to take notes during these meetings, etc.

In addition to communication tools, since there is no strong hierarchy in DAOs, it is also essential to establish workflow tools. Indeed, in many DAOs today, there is a strange loop of DAO leaders wanting members to launch initiatives, but members do not know what makes sense for the community and find themselves in a deadlock. Without robust workflows, potential contributors will quickly become discouraged and end up contributing nothing at all.

To overcome this, it is essential to create guilds (or working groups) with accessible documents outlining what is needed within each guild. For a DAO to function, there should be weekly meetings, an easily accessible task list, easy access to documentation with the names of guild contributors (with a contact person for any issues), etc. Most DAOs are still using the Google suite (created for Web2 use cases), and there is room for improvement in this space.

DAO leaders can also implement tools to enhance contributors' sense of trust or to encourage acts of kindness and support, two essential elements for contributors' well-being at work. For example

, this can be achieved by allowing anyone to send tips to other contributors via the Collab.land Discord bot.

### 1.3 – …And Then Let Me Do It… (Autonomy/Flexibility/Ownership)

Finally, a DAO must provide autonomy and flexibility to retain its contributors with the right tools and a strong culture.

Few people benefit from unfair scrutiny, and many studies support the positive outcomes inspired by autonomy. Autonomy relates to feelings of voice and control. DAOs are fluid by nature and offer ownership and great independence.

The flexibility offered by DAOs is also a significant advantage, as DAO leaders can provide contributors with the opportunity to work only on tasks they love. Contributors can work on a project and leave. The goal is not to involve them in every project but to have a culture and workflows strong enough to bring them back.

The downside of the DAO structure is that, without appropriate hierarchy, contributors must work on the project without receiving specific commands but deliver on time because they believe in the long-term goal and are immersed in the culture.

There is a thin line between allowing too much flexibility and not enough, and this line can vary between DAOs, depending on their contributors and culture.

With flexibility should also come ownership. The core team should give ownership of projects to contributors by allowing them to vote on important decisions and future missions, and ownership of the organization by allowing contributors to invest in the DAO and hold shares. Aligning incentives is everything in Web3.

Finally, I would encourage DAO leaders to overcompensate their contributors with their native token. With tokens come ownership and skin in the game. By doing so, DAO leaders will reinforce contributor retention with greater stakes in ownership and reduce attrition when the time comes.

## 2 – Structural Models

In addition to all these good management practices, good structural models can be put in place to retain contributors. In the second part of this essay, we will explore the two main models and how they can assist DAO leaders.

### 2.1 – The Reward Model (PUSH MODEL)

The reward model aims to push benefits and rewards to contributors to convince them to stay.

A good example of this model is what [Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/noun/84) does. Nouns are an experimental attempt to improve the formation of on-chain avatar communities. There is a new noun every day, and you must win the auction to get it.

Because 100% of the proceeds from noun auctions are sent to Nouns DAO, the Nounders have chosen to pay themselves with nouns. Every 10th noun for the first five years of the project (noun IDs #0, #10, #20, #30, etc.) will be automatically sent to the founders' multisig to be invested and shared among the founding members of the project (representing 10% of the supply for the first five years). This incentivizes the Nouns’ Nounders to work on this project as a long-term initiative.

This model also provides long-term stability for contributors, which is a significant advantage in an uncertain space like Web3.

Another excellent example is what the leaders of [Forefront](https://forefront.market/) have done. Through a liquidity mining program, they allowed their top contributors to invest in the DAO, with a one-year vesting period, meaning contributors cannot withdraw their money before a year. By doing so, they incentivize their contributors (now investors) to work hard and grow the project.

One last example of this model is what the [Global Coin Research](http://globalcoinresearch.com/) community does. The community is divided into three tiers (Pioneer – Alpha – Gold), with the minimum token requirement for each level increasing. Each month, they reward their members proportionally to their levels, incentivizing them to become Gold members and hold their tokens long-term.

This structural model is also good for increasing the speed of ownership, which means "how quickly can you put a significant amount of tokens in the hands of high-value contributors." With this model, DAO leaders also increase their contributors' ownership and decentralize their community a bit more.

As [Jess from Seedclub](https://twitter.com/thattallguy) said: The rare resource of web3 is talent. Ownership is a competitive advantage.

### 2.2 – The Membership Model (PULL MODEL)

In the Pull model, instead of providing rewards to incentivize people to stay, you encourage community members to become contributors and work to grow the DAO.

This is the model chosen by the [Friends With Benefits](https://www.fwb.help/join) community. They have implemented a subscription to access their community. Membership focuses on the longevity and health of the community, ensuring that FWB remains a place that we all continue to call home. Each season, they increase the minimum number of tokens a person should have to access the community, creating an active push for members to engage with a team of their choice, become contributors, and be rewarded with tokens for their work.

Other models and initiatives need to be explored. For example, I have not seen any DAO retain grants for members long-term. A portion of the treasury is allocated to embedded long-term members, not the core team. Another good way to ensure retention is also to pay contributors more than the market price. This is what Cabin DAO does, paying above standard market rates whenever possible, as they find themselves in a high-risk environment. If your token payments have high volatility, the salary should be well above a FAANG base salary.

## Conclusion

In a [recent essay](https://www.notboring.co/p/sc3nius), [Packy McCormick](https://twitter.com/packyM) explains that the “human mix” is one of the four components of a Scenius. As he argues: “If the genius groups of the past were all local malls, the internet is the global mall. It is difficult to exaggerate or even understand the impact of attracting people from all over the world to the same playing field.”

And I would go even further. We cannot underestimate the impact of incentivizing people from all over the world to work together in a completely new way, facilitated by a set of new tools and social tokens. DAOs have the potential to change the world by enabling collaboration and accelerating innovation. But this bright future will only be possible if these DAOs can retain their high-quality talent long-term.

To retain this high-quality talent, it is essential to implement the managerial and structural elements we explored in this essay and continue to explore new best practices directly applied to this new mode of collaboration.
