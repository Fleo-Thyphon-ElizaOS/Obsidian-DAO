### How DAOs Can Win the War for Active Contributors

The contributor is the cornerstone of a DAO. The quality of products launched, events organized, and governance decisions relies on the expertise, creativity, and commitment of the community. The ability to attract and retain talented contributors will determine which DAOs become the most successful Web3 organizations.

Today, DAOs don't lack interest but face the challenge of converting interested individuals into regular contributors. DAO operators can learn from Web2 strategies to compete for contributors as demand for DAO participation grows increasingly competitive.

**The Coming Battle for Contributors**

Significant progress has been made in DAO tooling, enabling any community to quickly deploy and manage a DAO without deep technical expertise. Tools like Discord, Gnosis, Openlaw, and Snapshot allow a community to bypass LLCs and create a DAO in just hours.

The ease of starting a DAO means there will be countless DAOs for contributors to choose from. The permissionless nature of contributions makes it easier than ever for contributors to shift their talents from one DAO to another. DAOs will inevitably engage in fierce competition to secure high-quality and consistent contributors.

Web2 spent years perfecting customer acquisition strategies, from which DAOs can learn as they develop their contributor base. A useful framework is the Web2 enterprise sales customer acquisition funnel.

**Customer Acquisition Funnel**

Enterprise software companies dedicate substantial resources to marketing their product to potential customers, reducing friction to close sales, creating an incredible user experience, and fostering customer loyalty.

The enterprise sales funnel illustrates the stages a potential customer goes through in the sales lifecycle:

- **Target:** individual targeted by the company's marketing campaigns
- **Visitor:** person who has heard of the product and visits the company's website to learn more
- **Lead:** person interested in the product and requests a conversation with the sales team
- **Paying Customer:** person who decides to purchase the product
- **Promoter:** person thrilled with their experience and actively promotes the product to others

Tracking the number of customers at each funnel stage and their conversion rates is essential for driving sales and marketing operations.

**Contributor Acquisition Funnel**

To win the battle for active community members, DAOs must view contributors similarly to how software companies view customers. For DAO operators, the Contributor Acquisition Funnel is a way to monitor their ability to attract contributors:

- **Stranger:** person unaware of the DAO
- **Lurker:** individual who joins Discord, passively observing conversations
- **Participant:** person actively asking questions and participating in discussions on Discord, learning about the roadmap and key initiatives to contribute
- **Occasional Contributor:** individual who has contributed to a project without needing deep context, like taking notes at a town hall or welcoming newcomers
- **Active Contributor:** person involved in a larger workflow focused on a strategic goal for the DAO. This consistent community member participates in broader, more complex projects and governance.

A DAO operator’s dashboard should prioritize contributor metrics, such as acquisition costs, contributions per contributor, and conversion rates between each funnel phase. Like an enterprise sales team, DAO core teams should track these metrics and be held accountable for their performance.

**Small Autonomous Teams Accountable for Results**

The beauty of DAOs lies in their ability to leverage the creativity of the community’s fringes, yet organization and accountability are necessary to unlock community potential.

Building a community of contributors is complex. DAOs can use the Contributor Acquisition Funnel Framework to break down the overall mandate into smaller focus areas that can be delegated to more agile, autonomous teams. In many DAOs, the community manager likely wears multiple hats: marketing, onboarding, community building, etc. Instead, the DAO can delegate responsibility to smaller guilds or sub-DAOs empowered to make decisions in their respective areas.

DAOs can also measure the impact of a team on the contributor community and assess whether the right teams are working on the right projects. Grant proposals may require teams to specify which metrics they aim to improve for the DAO and how they plan to do so. Here’s an example of how DAO teams can transparently show the value of their work, making it easy for the community to evaluate their outcomes.
