DAOs are on track to be the future of work: enabling anyone to work seamlessly for protocols that will change the world and transcend national borders. Rari Capital DAO has grown significantly, onboarding dozens of new contributors and engaging many more to join us in our mission. However, DAOs (including Rari Capital!) are quite inefficient in their current form. Here are a few examples of issues:

No accountability

No clear path to enter or move within the organization

Limited organizational growth due to rapid talent turnover

No insight into contributors' actual work within the DAO

These problems, along with many others, result in underperformance. While we’ve accomplished incredible things with the DAO, improving it could truly elevate us. I’ve pushed the Rari DAO to explore the limits of DAO infrastructure without shifting to a more centralized model because, after all, we’re a community-owned project.

### Social and Cultural Expectations

Before discussing the structure of the DAO, we need to align on our mission. The Rari Capital DAO is focused on building the future of finance. At its core, the mission is to empower people. We should enable people to reach this goal, whatever it means to them, starting with financial freedom. (I’m working on a blog post that delves into this topic.) This is a social mission that will likely change many lives (if executed correctly!), so social change should be central to the protocol. I encourage other contributors to initiate conversations about social issues and the role our DAO can play in helping the world. That said, these discussions should fuel us, not distract or divide us.

Every member of the DAO should work at their highest level of productivity. If not, they must understand the potential consequences (outlined below). Ensuring a productive team allows us to create a product that truly changes the world. Communication is essential in a DAO. Clearly explain everything to other contributors—if you’re struggling, thriving, or need something—let everyone (especially your bubble) know so we’re all on the same page.

With clear expectations in place, let’s talk about how the DAO itself should be organized.

### Overall Structure

I propose a solution that begins by organizing everyone within the DAO into “bubbles.” Each DAO will likely have its own structure, but for Rari Capital, each task we pursue can be divided into three main categories:

Operations: Overseeing protocol maintenance and active product management.

Strategy: Ensuring protocol growth and competitiveness at scale.

Development: Building and securing each product and protocol.

While these are the basic categories, they are not very specific. For that, I propose bubbles to function as working groups on specific goals. Think of these three categories as large bubbles with smaller bubbles inside. Below are examples of small bubbles for the categories described above:

Operations: Legal, relationship management, marketing (social, education, partnerships), security coordination, design, community management, contributor management.

Strategy: Protocol design, risk assessment, treasury management, bridging, direct TVL growth.

Development: Security tools, smart contracts, developer relations, internal tools, user interface.

These smaller bubbles have a few key components:

**Mission**: The purpose of the bubble, what it aims to accomplish over a longer timescale.

**KPIs**: Key performance indicators for this bubble. These can be quantitative or qualitative but should be outlined when the bubble is created, set by the owner, and tracked regularly (biweekly) in a public setting.

**Owner**: This person is responsible for reporting the progress of a bubble every two weeks. The constituents of a bubble vote for an owner, who can be replaced at any time, and if not, the bubble itself might dissolve (explained below). This person has no significant power over other individuals in the bubble.

The bubble organization promotes accountability while maintaining a relatively flat structure. I also note that anyone can “fork” a bubble and create their own “working group” on any topic if they feel the current bubble isn’t a good fit for them. All that’s required to start a new bubble is pure motivation. I imagine that in the future, there will be multiple “Design” bubbles within the organization. They might perform different tasks or compete for the DAO’s attention on the same tasks. I accept that there will be minor overlap in work (good communication should minimize this), but it will lead to better solutions. This is a future where the protocol doesn’t rely on any one individual and reduces centralization risks through bubbles. I strongly urge DAO members to contribute to only a few bubbles to avoid overextending. They should do a few things extremely well to maximize their impact.

Below is a diagram of Rari’s current organization under a bubble structure:

**Our DAO (full-time members only), in bubble format.**

I created the above map on Sobol, a new tool we’re using to materialize many of these ideas. Initially, we mapped it out on Figma, but after speaking with the Sobol team, it was clear they could be an excellent organizational partner. You can check out the map here.

Just because people are in bubbles doesn’t mean voters will instantly be held accountable. This is where the "Log" comes in. The "Log" started as a Google sheet where each team logs their progress/milestones every two weeks. With Sobol, we realized members can simply leverage the Posts feature to highlight what’s been worked on within a bubble over the previous two weeks (posted by the bubble owner). This is how we would track KPIs throughout the DAO.

Posts generate a “log,” which serves as public accountability, where anyone can view the posts of a bubble. We strive to make these updates accessible to all token holders.

**Posting an update to the rest of the DAO via posts**

The log is not a sprint manager. It’s just a way to report updates to all token holders. Rari Capital DAO allows each bubble to decide what sprint management solution works best for them but strongly encourages contributors to join the Rari Capital DAO Linear (open only to contributors). This Linear is synchronized to 2-week cycles, aligned with the timing of a “log update” required from a bubble owner.

**A glimpse of our Linear cycles**

A high-level overview like this will lead to much easier decision-making (hiring/firing/compensation) for the rest of the DAO. Finally, as bubbles need resources, they’ll work with treasury management to explore what’s feasible and draft a governance proposal for the DAO.

### Talent Flow

The Rari protocol needs to maintain access to the best talent in the ecosystem without bogging down the process like some other DAOs. There are two types of talent we expect to see in the protocol: part-time, grant-based work and full-time salaried work.

To start, the grant program designed by Samuel allows us to pursue part-time talent at scale. These grants allow individuals to dive into work with the current set of contributors and earn RGT without a long-term commitment. Securing a grant will streamline future applications to work for the DAO, as it provides a clear record of protocol-related work. The DAO will likely prefer to hire someone who has completed a series of grants over the last few months rather than someone entirely new to the community. The grant program will continue to run and grow alongside the rest of the organization.

For long-term talent, the process can be divided into four steps:

Talent search/capture: attracting top talent and integrating them directly into the DAO.

Talent applications: gathering data on talent to ensure they’re a good fit and placed in the right bubble(s), then preparing a talent dossier for a formal application to the DAO.

Talent onboarding: getting them into the contributor Discord, etc.

Talent retention: continually providing benefits to talent within the DAO.

I propose the following for how this long-term talent is managed within the DAO, divided by stage:

#### Talent Search/Capture:

- Every DAO member is encouraged to help with talent search by leveraging their own personal networks.
- The DAO may eventually look to formal recruiters based on future governance proposals.

#### Talent Applications:

- A public form (all data is public) will be distributed to all interested parties. It is modeled on the OlympusDAO form, and you can check out a draft here (fill it out if interested!). A spreadsheet will be created to distribute data to everyone as applications come in.
- A person within the recruitment bubble will formally review each applicant to the DAO and work with them on next steps to provide a “formal verification” of an individual.
- A formally verified individual can then follow the appropriate governance guidelines to fully integrate into the DAO following the example set by Samuel Shadrach here. In this proposal, they outline their compensation and responsibilities. Individuals can opt for a trial period like Samuel to prove themselves (and ensure they like working for the DAO), which likely results in a higher probability of being integrated into the DAO.

The DAO is unlikely to onboard individuals who haven’t completed at least one of the following: 1) received a formal verification from a recruitment member, 2) completed a trial period, or 3) obtained a grant for the protocol.

I’d also like the DAO to further explore creating a “Council” to manage individuals' salaries privately. The budget and council creation would be based on a future governance proposal. This will likely become necessary as the protocol scales, as DAO scaling in this capacity is challenging. However, I will work to reduce the power of this council.

#### Talent Onboarding:

- A member of the recruitment bubble will contact and add the individual to the Contributor Discord (discussed further below) once approved.
- Once part of the DAO, they will work with current collaborators in the bubbles they join.

#### Talent Retention:

The recruitment bubble should be sufficiently funded to reward the organization’s strongest members. These rewards could range from a gift card to AMC to a $RGT bonus. This proposal does not delve deeply into the mechanics of this, but I strongly suggest exploring this further at a later date.

#### Compensation

The Rari Capital DAO should be an extremely aggressive and competent player in terms of

 compensation. Ultimately, it’s up to the talent to decide what they’d like to ask of the DAO, but the recruitment bubble can provide insight (based on historical data and industry standards) on “suggested amounts.” We should publish these amounts as part of the recruitment bubble so that the larger ecosystem is aware.

To clarify, currently, Rari Capital DAO has little to no stables or ETH; it is largely allocated to RGT. However, this could change in the future through diversification. I believe that once the protocol is able to pay salaries in stables, then the $RGT distributed should be vested for a minimum of 3 years when working for the DAO. In the meantime, direct RGT payouts are the only way to remain competitive. Every dollar spent on salaries should provide exponential returns on the product.
