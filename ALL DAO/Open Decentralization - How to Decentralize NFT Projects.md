### **Open Decentralization: How to Decentralize NFT Projects**

Non-Fungible Token (NFT) projects and their communities are an emerging and increasingly popular type of Web3 system that provide a great opportunity to discuss some additional concepts of open decentralization.

First, it is important to understand the legal basis on which most artistic NFTs can be excluded from the U.S. Securities Act, namely that they fail the fourth prong of the **Howey Test**: the value of an NFT is largely intrinsic and does not derive from the efforts of others. However, as NFT projects have become more complex, the analysis of **Howey** has become less straightforward. NFT projects now often involve the creation of additional content/minting additional NFTs, implementing NFTs in video games, developing community-focused products, and other activities—which potentially increase holders' reliance on the management efforts of others.

Therefore, NFT projects should consider integrating decentralization principles into their Web3 systems, especially if they intend to couple the project with a fungible token. What would this NFT project decentralization model look like? The image below is an example. It reflects: (1) an NFT collection created on a blockchain and held by various users; (2) intellectual property brought into the NFT community, likely related to the NFTs themselves (which could be **staked** in the community by holders) and any community-created traditions; (3) distribution of digital assets and incentive mechanisms; (4) launching DAO governance regarding community intellectual property and the DAO treasury; (5) initiating derivative projects; and (6) organizing social gatherings and events.

In this model, the economic decentralization of NFT projects can be achieved in several steps:

1. **Firstly**, the DAO could use its initial resources for community engagement (e.g., Twitter, Discord, etc.) and to fund social gatherings and other events, thereby strengthening the community's **implicit incentives** (i.e., its popularity).

2. **Secondly**, these **implicit incentives**—as well as **explicit incentives** (such as fungible symbolic rewards, access to NFT sales, etc.)—could then be used to incentivize the creation of **derivative projects** using the community's intellectual property. Developers would receive rewards for developing such projects, and consumers would receive rewards for their use. For example, the DAO could employ a third-party developer to create a play-to-earn game using community characters, with in-game tokenomics featuring the community's native digital asset. In this regard, derivative projects act similarly to the clients described in previous open decentralization models, making the overall system less reliant on a single source to generate value for NFT holders, thereby helping to limit the risk of significant information asymmetries.

3. **Finally**, another important tool available to NFT projects is the **royalties on secondary NFT sales** going back to the DAO, which can fuel their decentralized economies. These royalties would provide the DAO with a decentralized revenue stream during periods when derivative projects might not generate sufficient returns for the system.

Ultimately, the combination of value returning to the ecosystem from derivative projects and secondary sales could lead to the creation of a healthy decentralized economy for the NFT project.

From a legal decentralization perspective, the key questions would again be: Are essential managerial efforts from a third party necessary to ensure the success or failure of the Web3 system? And is there a risk of significant information asymmetries arising? The answer to these two questions would depend on many of the considerations mentioned above.

But, in this case, intellectual property in the NFT scenario likely **contributes** rather than hinders the overall decentralization of the community. Why? Because the intellectual property is brought into the DAO from a decentralized source (the NFT holders). Moreover, if the DAO were to control token distributions, additional minting of NFTs and decentralized intellectual property—as well as decentralized revenue streams (coming either from royalties or derivative projects)—the system would likely not develop significant information asymmetries.

Most NFT projects are still in their infancy, so we haven’t yet seen many examples of NFT projects deploying decentralized tokenomics, but we expect to see a variety of mechanisms. In the meantime, many learnings can also be integrated into NFT projects from other Web3 systems.
