This duality could well disappear thanks to new Web 3.0 companies and the unprecedented funding methods they have at their disposal. Indeed, to finance a project, these companies can launch an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), a public cryptocurrency offering, rather than conducting an Initial Public Offering (IPO), which is a public stock purchase offer. This allows them to start their activity. The issued cryptocurrency will serve as a local currency, akin to a micro-economy for businesses, enabling transactions for the goods and/or services they offer.

The value of these cryptocurrencies compared to fiat currencies (euros, dollars, yen, etc.) will increase based on the utility of the company. That is, the more people want to access its services, the wealthier the holders of the associated token will become in fiat currency if they choose to exchange it. Moreover, the programmable nature of cryptocurrencies allows for the creation of an entire ecosystem in which it is possible, through nudges, to incentivize individuals to provide work for the company in exchange for token rewards.

What is revolutionary about this new funding model is that it allows company members to emancipate themselves from the yoke of institutional shareholders (banks, hedge funds, mutual funds, etc.) by opening funding for their projects directly to individual investors. Thus, the distinction between shareholders, employees, and customers blurs within the token itself, which then acts as a local currency, salary, and share.

Financial disintermediation, much like the democratic disintermediation discussed by Tocqueville in the preamble, enables holders of a token issued by a company to multiply opportunities to engage with its affairs. Therefore, the common interest is the sustainability of the company and the organic growth of its utility over time, as opposed to the mechanical growth imposed by shareholders wielding excessive power over it.

Furthermore, rather than merely decentralizing transactions and consensus, the services of these new companies aim to disintermediate services: Uber without Uber, Amazon without Amazon, central bank without a central bank, etc., by directly connecting the demander with the provider in a peer-to-peer manner while maintaining maximum security. By eliminating third-party intermediaries who capture value from executed exchanges, power dynamics tend to diminish, and value tends to be shared more equitably.

This also allows for a shift from a short-term perspective to a long-term vision. As emphasized by economist and sustainable development doctor Saifedean Ammous in his book "The Bitcoin Standard," the debt-based currencies imposed by states and central banks discourage saving, as it tends to erode over time with inflation. The lack of savings caused by the consumption incentives of these currencies hinders investment in the future, whereas a deflationary currency like Bitcoin, which we will examine in the next section, encourages "savings and investments that extend the size of the production cycle and increase productivity, leading to better living conditions" (Ammous, 2019, p. 100). This example thus highlights how monetary heteronomy can be replaced by one of the tools of Web 3.0 and how other forms of heteronomy can also be replaced.

The machinistic dogma of human governance then transforms into an organic paradigm. Instead of seeking to align human organization with socio-economic machinery, the technical infrastructure is designed to adapt to human needs and purposes. This transition, previously unachievable due to human complexity and the underlying trust issues, is made possible by the combination of several technological building blocks.

The two main components are blockchain, a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) ledger that enables informational transparency and decentralization, and asymmetric cryptography, which ensures trust by securing exchanges. Given that information asymmetry and trust are key factors influencing dominant/submissive power dynamics, these technologies essentially offer decision-making power to return to the state of nature discussed by Thomas Paine, for whom equality entails equal enjoyment of goods and land. This is accomplished by allowing everyone to have access to information and decision-making power on equal footing, thanks to the transparent and auditable nature of distributed P2P ledgers that comprise blockchains.

Asymmetrical information enables the circulation of a mandate and thus constitutes a control system, as Deleuze warned during a conference given at the "Tuesdays of the Foundation" on March 17, 1987. Control societies foster inequality since there are controllers and the controlled. However, it has been proven that symmetrical information dissemination within a company promotes knowledge sharing and is a guarantee of fulfillment for the individuals who work there (Jacob & Pariat, 2000).

Furthermore, complete transparency regarding who earns what within a work collective opens a dialogue questioning the legitimacy of each individual's claim to capture varying proportions of the value created by those working together within a company. "The life of an Indian is a day of constant celebration compared to that of a poor person in Europe; while it seems abject when compared to that of a rich person. Civilization, or what we call such, has therefore operated in two ways: it has made part of society more prosperous and the other part more miserable compared to what their lot would have been in a natural state" (Paine, 1987, p. 53). Indeed, in the anarchic organization made possible by these technologies, value creation, often captured by an oligopoly, would tend to be distributed more equally, if not justly, since the goal of such an organization is to achieve a global consensus among employees. These consensus mechanisms will be explained in detail in section 3.3.

This organic nature of the enterprise, enabled by a libertarian praxis that we will explore in the second part, allows for structuring a dynamic system comprised of a human collective working toward its healthy development, thereby making this type of organization a learning organization (Argyris & Sch√∂n, 2001), turning the enterprise into a living system in relation to its ecosystem, where each actor is encouraged toward systemic thinking, personal mastery, mental models, shared vision, and team learning (Senge, 2015). Engaging all the singularities comprising a work collective is the central element for achieving consensus; thus, the dissolution of hierarchy through decentralization emerges as the most serious alternative for ensuring that everyone's voice can be heard within a company.

Finally, the most interesting aspect of Web 3.0 tools is undoubtedly the programmability they offer. Programming work standards through systemic consensus allows workers in a Web 3.0 organization to renormalize the framework in which they operate according to changes and variability in their environment. This necessarily increases dialogue, cooperation, and thus the organic agility of the enterprise. Tokenomics, or the economy of tokens that we will address in section 4.4.2, enables the construction of interest alignment and dialogue engineering within human collectives.

These are the areas of exploration for this research thesis, which aims to better understand the challenges of an anarchic organization of work driven by the internet of value.
