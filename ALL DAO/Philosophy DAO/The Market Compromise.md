**Autonomy and Renormalization**

With modern workers increasingly demanding autonomy and the ability to express their unique human qualities, today's emphasis often lies on the responsibilities and initiatives employees can take for the organization. However, Alain Supiot warns that it is counterproductive to "call upon the initiative and responsibility of workers while treating them as marketable assets" (2010, p. 144).

Without allowing employees to collectively renormalize the work activity, companies merely engage in psycho-emotional engineering, manipulating **desires and shaping subjectivities** to meet **productivity and profitability goals**.

Yves Clot refers to this psychological manipulation as "an engineering of professional suffering" (2015, p. 131), complementing existing financial and strategic management. He sees these seemingly benevolent manipulations as "a kind of neo-Fordism, cushioned by a veil of compassion," where productivity pressures are equipped with psychological buffers (Clot, 2015, p. 145). Yet, these "psychological buffers" fail to alleviate the profound suffering linked to the inability to act independently. Paul Ricoeur describes such suffering not only as physical or mental pain but as **"the erosion, if not destruction, of the capacity to act, to 'do,' experienced as an assault on one's integrity"** (1990, p. 223).

The capacity to act is essential to the balance of life; deprived of this, life itself withers. Similarly, the collective dimension of this capacity is vital in the workplace. "The team collectively experiences its power to act within and upon its environment... Bank tellers and postal workers initiate a form of work organization that translates and sustains the official work organization against real-life challenges" (Clot, 2015, p. 99).

Through collaborative work organization, a team can resist heteronomy. Yet, the opportunity for such collective renormalization is rarely granted to them.
