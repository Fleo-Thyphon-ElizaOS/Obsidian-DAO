Inter-autonomy is the goal of dialogue among mutually dependent protagonists in work.

[[Yves Schwartz]] prefers the term protagonist to that of agent or actor to emphasize the centrality of individuals as the main characters in the narrative unfolding on the stage of work, much like an actor playing the lead role in ancient Greek theater. This implies an "intrinsic equality" for the political dimension of work, so that the protagonists can evolve collectively, exchange, and all participate together in decision-making.

# Status of Workers

According to Schwartz, **“devalued beings as workers, whether current, former, or future, underrepresented in their contribution to social or cultural wealth, cannot be partners, proposers, or effective links in a conquering policy”**(1998, p. 303).

# Socratic Attitude

This means that without a Socratic attitude, free from any hierarchical position in the dialogue among the protagonists of a work collective, **the political dimension would be impoverished**.

**“Socrates' attitude toward his interlocutors [...] is exactly the same as the one he has toward himself. Everyone needs examination, and all are equal in the face of argument”** (Nussbaum, 2011, p. 68).

# Theorists / Practitioners

That is why ergology has developed a dynamic three-pole framework that is a **“two-way Socratic dialogue”** between the pole of **established knowledge** and the pole of **invested knowledge** in order to unify the polarities of prescribed work and real work within the collective.

# DAOs

This **unifying** approach between theorists and practitioners of work is a form of consensus among the various protagonists of a collective that the libertarian organization of work enabled by blockchains seeks to resolve through the establishment of a [[DAO]] that fluidifies dialogue.

**It is enough to give a voice to everyone for the opinions of all to resonate.**

Rather than impoverishing the political dimension of work with managers as third-party decision-makers, Web 3.0 opens the way toward a decntralize governance  that can enrich it.

**“The blockchain associated with Bitcoin, as a collaborative database, eliminates the need for a trusted third party. The transparent and collaborative nature of the blockchain could, in theory, help small or large communities achieve **consensus** and implement innovative forms of governance.

These potentials create opportunities and challenges worth exploring and experimenting with”** (Bauwens & Kostakis, 2017, p. 8).

# Algorithmic Governance

The opportunities offered by algorithmic governance programmed in inter-autonomy, far from being limited to the framework of work alone, can transform **“the human capacity to create intersubjective worlds for better cooperation”** (Harari, 2015, p. 162) and revolutionize ways of transacting between peers, just as the first fiat currencies did.

**“The global economic system, in all its complexity, ultimately rests on **the aggregation of a multitude of transactions between private, public, individual, or collective actors offering or demanding goods, services, or values**.

Transactions are ubiquitous; their current form is the result of thousands of years of history”** (Della Chiesa, 2019, p. 17).

Fundamentally, transactional forms are **living and evolving**. Wage labor and the subordinate relationships it entails are by no means inevitable for human organization and are destined, like other forms, to evolve.

The opportunities offered by algorithmic governance programmed in inter-autonomy can transform **the human capacity to create intersubjective worlds for better cooperation** and revolutionize the ways of transacting between peers, just as the first fiat currencies did.
