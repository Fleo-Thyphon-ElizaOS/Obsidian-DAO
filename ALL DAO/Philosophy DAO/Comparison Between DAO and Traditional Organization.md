To summarize, a DAO can be compared to a traditional organization in the following ways:

- **Activities are transparent and fully public** vs. **private activity limited to a specific audience**.
- **Every memberâ€™s vote is required for any change** vs. **changes driven by a single party**.
- **Typically horizontal, without hierarchy, and fully democratized** vs. **generally hierarchical**.
- **Votes are recorded by smart contracts, applying results automatically** vs. **manual processing if voting is allowed**.
- **Services are decentralized and automated** vs. **centralized with human intervention and manipulation**.

### Community = Strength
DAOs represent the decentralized power of governance on distributed ledgers. Any collective on a blockchain aiming to prioritize the community in its project design must inevitably establish its own DAO. Automating numerous tasks and embedding organizational rules within a collaboratively developed algorithm allows a renewed focus on the essentials of any organization: **the human factor and communication**.

This raises a question regarding egalitarian consensus within these governance systems: will the most power-hungry individuals attempt to take control of the most significant DAOs in the ecosystem by skewing consensus mechanisms to their advantage? This is likely to happen. This is why it is essential to be proactive in designing and programming protocols that support an egalitarian consensus, preventing any oligopoly from seizing control.

### Skin in the Game
In any field, there will always be a small proportion of individuals tempted to cheat or engage in malicious acts that undermine the organizational dynamics of a collective. However, it is possible to create an environment where such acts cannot occur due to the infrastructure of the code. The Bitcoin protocol has continuously demonstrated this since its inception in 2009. Since the cost of attacking the protocol far exceeds potential gains, malicious actors are quickly deterred, leaving them with no choice but to align their interests with others or exit the protocol. Designed this way, a DAO can only foster virtuous behavior.
