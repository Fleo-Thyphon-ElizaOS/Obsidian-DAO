Bitcoin is, in a way, the culmination of extensive research aimed at creating virtual, anonymous currencies whose transactions cannot be traced. However, this last claim is not entirely true for Bitcoin, as its ledger is public and transparent to everyone. Only "pseudonymity" protects users' privacy, as it hides their identity behind a line of code, which itself is traceable, allowing the origin of bitcoins to be tracked.

It's essential to distinguish between "Bitcoin" with a capital "B," which refers to the protocol that enables the ledger to operate with Bitcoin-specific characteristics (encryption, hashing, nonce, P2P, timestamping, consensus, etc.), and "bitcoin" with a lowercase "b," which is the virtual currency exchanged on the Bitcoin network. To understand how this groundbreaking software protocol was developed, we need to take a brief look at its history.

Bitcoin, due to its characteristics, can be considered digital gold. It is also a store of value, albeit a volatile one, yet its price has consistently appreciated over time since its inception.

It serves as a tool for speculation and investment. However, speculation alone is insufficient, and, for now, Bitcoin lacks a unit of account, which currently excludes it from the category of true currencies. Its still relatively small market contributes to its high volatility, and it is only minimally used as a medium of exchange.

Itâ€™s also worth noting that speculation requires hedging (risk coverage), which has encouraged the emergence of new cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins.
