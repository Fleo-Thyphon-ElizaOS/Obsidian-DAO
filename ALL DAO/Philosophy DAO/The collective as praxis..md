Thus, libertarian praxis encourages the diversification of the singular thoughts of each individual by never imposing a coercive conceptual framework or dominant thought.

This philosophy aims to enhance the autonomy of individuals in the etymological sense of the term: "autos," meaning self, and "nomos," meaning rules, which gives "autonomous" — governed by its own rules and laws.

Through the interactional richness of a multitude of autonomous beings, the collective becomes a praxis. **“We call praxis that doing in which the other or others are targeted as autonomous beings and considered the essential agents in the development of their own autonomy. True politics, true pedagogy, true medicine, to the extent that they have never existed, belong to praxis”** (Castoriadis, 1975). The _telos_, the end of praxis, is to elevate praxis itself.

The collective becomes praxis as it advocates for greater autonomy for individuals in their ability to have a significant impact on the material world, and in their capacity to shape, through shared work and action, the symbolic and institutional worlds in which they develop.

In the Marxian sense of self-production of the individual through their actions, the collective as praxis emancipates individuals who remain actors in their work, freeing them from the gears of a productive machine whose ends and means would completely escape their prerogatives, such as the right to initiative, expression, or participation in projects.

Libertarian praxis places others at its center; alterity, as Castoriadis rightly noted above, is targeted by praxis and conceived within it as the articulation of autonomous agents who can collectively modify their way of life or institutional paradigm in which the collective is inscribed.

In ergological language, we could say that libertarian praxis is a sine qua non condition for the renormalization of prior norms.

The collective also becomes praxis in the sense that [[Wittgenstein]] analyzes what it implies to follow a _nomos_ (a rule) for an individual caught in a form of life (a paradigm) necessarily shaped collectively, constituting a prior norm that is too heteronomous. To be autonomous, the collective as praxis must carry within itself a value and propose to inhabit the daily life of the community by placing human relationships as an end while refusing to yield to other interests and strategies that exclude the complex and intertwined dimension of the dialogue between practice and theory that the notion of praxis proposes (Rozier, 2014).
