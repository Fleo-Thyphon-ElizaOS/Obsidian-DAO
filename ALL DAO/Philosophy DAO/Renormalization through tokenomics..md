The tokenomics of a blockchain project, based on convincing users/investors that the token derived from it can help build a sustainable economic ecosystem, allows for the unification of a community around a common project that supports the principles and objectives of such development.

Each project being interoperable with others enables the creation of a genuine economy of the commons, emancipated from neoliberal heteronomy.

Thus, it would be possible to finance human, environmental, and ecosystem-oriented projects by creating a protocol that automatically rewards the physical or digital services rendered, just as cryptocurrency miners, like those of Bitcoin, are compensated for creating new blocks of information and participating in securing the Bitcoin blockchain network.

The goal would then be to create projects that make the most sense for collectives, rather than employing people in demeaning bullshit jobs that exist solely for the purpose of being paid.

Programming a meaningful world, rather than being programmed by a world that lacks meaning. "The dismantling of the 'Fordist pact' allows for the consideration of a new social pact based on the freedom and responsibility of individuals, rather than on their subordination or programming" (Supiot, 2010, p. 135).

The dismantling of the Fordist compromise has been reassembled into neo-Fordism, where in this "cybernetic universe of regulation and governance, human beings do not act: they react to signals they receive from the information systems in which they are embedded" (2015, p. 131).

**The neoliberal narrative is a vector of alienation that tells people that true freedom lies in consumption.**

The common experience we share as interdependent human beings is merely the product of the stories we choose to believe. If we adhere to the market narrative that relegates individuals to the status of _homo economicus_ or _homo consumatus_, we must accept the consequences and live in a reality where meaning is overshadowed by consumption. Conversely, if we choose to rewrite our common story, the renormalization power of Web 3.0 could help us co-create a meaningful common world. "Stories create [...] connections between those who tell them, provide coherence to experience, allow for meaning to emerge, and foster constructive exchanges" (Pagès, 2014, p. 63).

If companies start adopting this model, we could see the emergence of a new form of economy. Similarly, if citizens adopt it, a new political model could come into being.

Are DAOs a utopia or an abstraction?

Self-fulfilling trend?
