It is essential to distinguish here between communism and Marxism.

### Communism
A state of society free from social class divisions, where everyone can access shared resources equally.

### Marxism
The struggle against the ruling class as an imperative to achieve communism.

### Pursuit of Freedom
Communism and Marxism are often conflated, overlooking that Marxism is a byproduct of the original idea of communism (distorted by capitalism), seeking a return to this lost primitive communism (Nemo, 2013), and certainly not the other way around.

Communism as an ideal was only pursued through Karl Marx’s dialectical materialism, which fell **into decline** by the late 20th century in the face of the **capitalist model’s success**.

However, if capitalism triumphed over communism, this was due less to the ideological difference between a highly unequal society that practices accumulation and a totally egalitarian society that avoids hoarding (Testart, 2005), and more to the decentralized structure of market organization, which is **undeniably far more efficient than the planned economy of Marxist centralization**.

To the illusion of such a command, planned economy, economist Karl Polanyi, as early as 1922, opposed the ethical necessity of a decentralized economy involving the responsibility of **associated producers** without detaching (“disembedding”) the social element from the economy, allowing the market—a mere organizing fiction of the social realm—to control society (Polanyi, 1984). The aim is to preserve human purpose and avoid replacing it with an authoritarian means, be it capitalist or communist.

This authoritarian, anti-anarchist tendency among Marxists was condemned by the Russian philosopher and revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin:

“According to [the Marxists], this state yoke, this dictatorship, is a necessary transition phase to achieve the complete emancipation of the people: anarchy or freedom being the goal, the State or dictatorship the means. Thus, to **liberate the popular masses, one must begin by enslaving them**. For now, our controversy has stopped at this contradiction. The Marxists claim that only a dictatorship—naturally, theirs—can create the people’s freedom; to this, we respond that no dictatorship can have any end other than to last as long as possible and that it is only capable of generating slavery in the people who endure it and of educating them in that slavery; freedom can only be created by freedom, that is, by the uprising of the entire people and by the free organization of the working masses from the bottom up” (Bakunin, 2012, p. 241).
