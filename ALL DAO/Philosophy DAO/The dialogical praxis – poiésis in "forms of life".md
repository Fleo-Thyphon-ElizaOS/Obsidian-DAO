It is not ideas or opinions that determine practice, but the exact opposite. This implies that the neoliberal paradigm, what Wittgenstein calls the "form of life," is not a determining fate of social practices, but rather a form of life among many others that can be transformed according to the collective praxis that prevails in society.

Human mental states and processes lead them to modify their environment, which in turn, after altering the environment, transforms the mental states of human organisms (Sperber, 1996).

This shows that praxis is evolutionary; it is the renewal at every moment of the form of life.

The insidious trap of modern times lies in **the refusal of the system to renew itself**, which hinders the free course of praxis and keeps the human collective captive to a moribund paradigm.

We return then to the forgetfulness of world 2 of [[Karl Popper]], the subjective one of values, at the expense of the objective structures of world 3, which are then employed only for the production of the material things of world 1. This framework we saw in the preamble highlights the process of alienation of man, who becomes trapped in his own intersubjective fictions. The end result is an atrophy of the subjective and collective dimension of work.

Here, praxis again becomes the good and useful poiésis of Plato, denying all the progress made in the human dimension of praxis from Aristotle to [[Wittgenstein]]. Pierre-Yves Gomez criticizes this hypertrophy of the objective dimension of work, which denies the subjective and collective dimensions. For him, "this negation of the worker, which makes him transparent to his interlocutor, is one of the greatest violences one can inflict" (2013, pp. 174-175).

Wittgenstein himself considers that we ultimately become prisoners of our form of life, of our activities structured by different rules, and advocates a philosophical praxis of the ordinary, of the daily, as therapeutic work to free praxis from alienation.

According to Wittgenstein, a solitary man does not follow a rule; it is the act of a community of people who agree in their actions. This is why a libertarian praxis finds its meaning in the transdisciplinarity it implies to solve societal issues as protean as ecology, economy, social issues, health, etc.

This dialogical praxis-poiésis thus defines the relationship of man to his world. The collective, which is the most powerful lever for modifying these relationships, constitutes, in fact, a praxis par excellence. The collective is at the same time a factor of the alienation of the dominant paradigm while being **a factor of emancipation due to the renormalizing power that libertarian praxis can offer**. "All social life is essentially practical. All the mysteries that lead theory to mysticism find their rational solution in human practice and in the understanding of that practice" (Marx, 1982). It is to deepen this understanding crucial to appropriate praxis that Wittgenstein invites us to philosophize daily, individually and collectively.

For, as the scholar Nicolas Boileau so aptly said, it is **at the clash of ideas that light emerges!**
