Thus, Tocqueville calls for grounding citizens in political life through decentralization, federalism, and direct, participatory democracy. He is highly critical of the equality of conditions promoted by representative democracy, which, he argues, homogenizes individual thought, causing people to lose their freedom of mind, independence of opinion, and leading their ideas to quickly become common. “Of all the political effects produced by equality of conditions, it is this love of independence that first strikes the eye and that timid minds fear... However, I am convinced that anarchy is not the principal evil that democratic centuries should fear, but rather the lesser one. Equality indeed produces two tendencies: one directly leads men to independence and may suddenly push them to anarchy; the other leads them along a longer, more secret but surer path, toward servitude” (p. 54).

For Tocqueville, independence is understood as a state of mind, a *sine qua non* condition for a rich and varied community life. Anarchy represents equality in decision-making power, or the self-determination each person can exercise over themselves; it guarantees the intellectual diversity of people who remain free to reshape reality.

For the philosopher Hannah Arendt, this plurality is a factual condition of political action. “Human plurality, the fundamental condition of action and speech, has the dual character of equality and distinction. If men were not equal, they could neither understand each other nor those who came before them, nor prepare the future and foresee the needs of those who will come after them. If men were not distinct, each being different from any other being present, past, or future, they would need neither speech nor action to be understood. Signs and sounds would suffice to communicate immediate and identical desires and needs” (Arendt, 2002, p. 194).

Similarly, Claude Lévi-Strauss condemns the standardization of culture, likening it to a monoculture of mass civilization, akin to a beet monoculture (Lévi-Strauss, 1955, p. 127). Just as ecology teaches us that the resilience of an ecosystem depends on its biodiversity, philosophy teaches us that humanity’s resilience depends on its “psychodiversity” (Méheust, 2012)—the plurality of ideas, a richness that underpins our capacity to create, innovate, and reshape the environment in which we live.

Innovative paradigms can only emerge from a rich intellectual substrate, diverse in ideas. Without evolving our thinking frameworks, it is unlikely that we can establish the new norms needed to address the growing crises we face: health, ecological, environmental, economic, political, social, managerial, spiritual, and so on.

Today, the notion of governance—traditionally centralized by intermediaries that constrained the plurality of human thought within a fixed democratic paradigm—is evolving toward a governance of diversity, one that is fully decentralized and autonomous. This shift is driven by new technologies that completely disrupt our political philosophy. This paradigm shift is inherent to technologies linking blockchain and cryptography.

While this preamble focuses primarily on the macro level, exploring governance challenges in large institutions such as representative democracies, it serves to better assimilate the paradigm shift that governance revolution entails at the micro level within work collectives, where the political dimension cannot be ignored. In ergological terms, this involves a “detachment” in thinking to deepen the concept of decentralization, which, without any wordplay, is central to studying the actions of Web 3.0 technologies and the organizational tools they offer for governance.

The remainder of this thesis will adhere more closely to real work situations and focus on the concrete effects of tools provided by the Internet of Value. Specifically, it will explore how these new technologies enhance the quality of dialogue by dialecticizing knowledge and sharing renormalizations through a qualitative dialogical leap in collectives. With this reflection on governance, we can now pose the following questions:

What organizational transformations are proposed by the Internet of Value? How can these technologies enable an efficient anarchic organization? In what ways could anarchy surpass the aforementioned alternative forms of work organization? Why do blockchains and cryptocurrencies represent a paradigm shift? What suggests that this change could positively evolve social bonds? What benefits could companies, regardless of size, gain from adopting these new tools?

But before we begin to answer these questions, we will start by examining the organizational evolution of the world of work, from Taylorism to modern forms of alternative organization that focus more on the human aspect, though often lacking in finality due to ever-growing productivity demands in competitive economies. This will provide a transition to the disruption that blockchain tools offer the workers of tomorrow through their unprecedented applications.
