The renowned economist John Maynard Keynes once said, “The difficulty lies not in new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones that ramify, for those of us brought up as most of us have been, into every corner of our minds.” The conditioning of individuals within neoliberal conformity stifles any form of renewal. Libertarian praxis, far from merely reorganizing roles and authorities within a system, proposes a paradigm shift where the ratification of a collective work constitution is no longer solely the leader’s prerogative but a privilege shared by everyone within the organization, allowing the implementation of a collective *nomos*.

Can we then speak of governance, *kratos*, by the whole, *holos*, of the collective, rather than a mere illusion of freedom where only the roles hold the power? This is where Web 3.0 tools provide fundamental solutions for libertarian praxis. The paradigm shift inherent to blockchains paves the way for the new forms of governance that organizational anarchy requires. Libertarian work organization becomes possible through the renormalization potential offered by the Internet of Value, which allows, for example, the creation of programmable currency and a new socio-economic system enabling systemic and even holistic decision-making.

Thus, instead of working solely for *poiesis* (the mere production of wealth), this new paradigm centers *poiesis* within *praxis*, producing wealth to ground individuals in practice and continuous self-improvement. The conceptual framework shifts from asking how to find money to carry out a project to asking how to create a project that can gather enough interest to warrant creating a token and a blockchain protocol that incentivizes collaboration to achieve the project’s goals.

To recall, the tokenization of the economy is a new economic model that blockchains make possible.

This involves raising funds to realize a project through an ICO (Initial Coin Offering), offering a token in exchange—a cryptocurrency programmed based on the project’s objective.

The funds raised can support anything from a humanitarian cause to a personal project that attracts investors’ attention.

In this way, anyone can create their cryptocurrency and develop the program that best suits the project’s goals as laid out in its white paper.

By doing so, a worker could create their salary by working within the protocol.

This approach completely upends the current monetary paradigm, where sovereignty is required to create currency; here, currency is created to enable sovereignty.

This removes the economic constraints imposed by the neoliberal framework, establishing a new framework where large financial or banking entities are no longer necessary to fund projects.

In this paradigm, creativity and offering projects with real value to the world are all that’s needed to attract people and secure peer-to-peer funding, creating an ideal framework for workers.

The project creator alone will be responsible for crafting a healthy, empowering professional environment where each individual can flourish in true freedom and self-determination, contributing to meaningful work.

When a project is not limited by the outdated neoliberal system and can contribute to a new system, there is no need to confine people to dehumanizing roles. On the contrary, human innovation is encouraged and can leverage tools such as smart contracts, consensus mechanisms that incentivize virtuous behavior, or governance tokens that allow collective voting on the structure of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), aligning the organization with its objectives.
