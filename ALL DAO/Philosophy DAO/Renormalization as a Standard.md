The true value of Web 3 tools lies in the empowering potential they offer to collectives, enabling the redistribution of power equally and/or justly within an organization.

For people in the workplace, everything begins with pre-existing norms. 

This ergological concept emphasizes the rules that predate any worker entering a job. These pre-existing norms establish an essential framework, the product of accumulated experience, without which work would not be feasible.

For **Yves Schwartz**, “pre-existing norms are defined concerning human action by two characteristics: anteriority and anonymity” (2009, p. 258). 

This constitutes a necessary primary heteronomy that makes work possible.

# Recasting norms
However, since work activity is always performed here and now by a singular subject, Schwartz notes, “**activity corresponds to a unique individual’s ever-renewed attempt to replay, within a present configuration, norms that are both prior to action and anonymous**. Thus, in presenting some degree of contradiction to these norms, pre-existing norms make human activity possible” (p. 258).

According to **Bernard Stiegler**, “’autonomy’ always stems from [...] a primary heteronomy, meaning ‘autonomy’ is always relative: this relative autonomy is relational autonomy, and relational autonomy (also dialogic) is what creatively engages with the transitional space. It is what invents norms in the face of the enormity of pathogenesis” (Stiegler, 2010. p. 428).

While pre-existing norms, as prescriptions, may initially appear restrictive, they nonetheless assist the worker in performing their tasks. They provide support, granting access to accumulated knowledge and the empirical experience of a role rich in history.

# Norms support tasks
Individually and collectively, engaging with heteronomy is part of life.

Yves Schwartz emphasizes that every person “is subject to internal debates, ‘norm debates,’ some more visible to others and ourselves than others, some more hidden as well. [...] To speak of the ‘dramatic’ dimension of activity [...] means that nothing in this action can be ‘mechanical,’ and nothing can be purely the ‘application’ of what has been thought out without you, before you” (2009, pp. 221-222).

# Giving norms long-term meaning

**To simplify, heteronomy is like a moldable normative clay that we are given to shape and reshape, transforming an abstract *nomos* into one that has meaning.

The modern enterprise, as a hetero-directed space, does not recognize renormalization as a normal part of work activity. Instead, new organizational forms lean toward modifying individual behavior through nudges—small prompts to encourage desired actions (Thaler & Sunstein, 2012)—to maintain **modern employment demands** under a “governance by numbers” that inhibits participation in decisions.

**Bound solely by necessity and constrained in their agency, workers are destined to suffer.**
