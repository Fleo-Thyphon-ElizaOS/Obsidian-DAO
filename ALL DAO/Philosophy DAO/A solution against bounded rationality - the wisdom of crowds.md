Web 3.0, as a decentralized internet, is an ideal platform for utilizing tools that promote inter-autonomy fundamental to the richness of disintermediated governance.

In traditional governance models, those who hold decision-making power struggle to make the right choices by trying to aggregate the information available to them.

However, as demonstrated by Nobel laureate Herbert Simon, an individual's decision-making capacity is affected by a set of constraints such as lack of information, cognitive biases, emotional state, and time pressure, among others.

He refers to this as bounded rationality (Simon, 1957).

Simon critiques the supposed infallibility and autonomy of individual decisions that neoclassical theories aim to demonstrate in their model based on a perfectly rational decision-maker, made after a period of deep reflection and not by chance.

Indeed, each individual seeking to maximize their utility and profit, in order to meet their needs, will strive to take advantage of complete and relevant information to which they have unrestricted access, in order to make optimal decisions.

This extremely reductive model does not seek to reflect reality but rather to predict it through theoretical modeling.

For liberals, the only measure of a theory's worth is its ability to predict the future.

In contrast, collective decisions allow for the processing of much more information, a greater variety of profiles whose biases compensate for one another, and bring more originality to decisions through the richness of different perspectives and ideas interacting.

Collective intelligence theories support this notion, suggesting that numerous and varied interactions enable a large group of ordinary citizens to make better decisions than a small group of individuals who may be much more competent.

Aristotle stated nearly two millennia ago that "the majority, each member of which is not a remarkable man, is nevertheless above superior men" (1995).

More than just collective intelligence, Cambridge scholars speak of collective wisdom, an emergent and systemic property of a group that arises from cooperation among a diverse array of individuals and certain tools or institutions (Landemore & Elster, 2012, p. 8).

This theory challenges the modern epistemocratic system in which human collectives are governed by technocrats and pseudo-experts who hold decision-making monopolies.

Thus, true knowledge may reside more within human collectives.

In "The Wisdom of Crowds," James Surowiecki explains that aggregating information within a group of amateurs often leads to a better assessment of data than what an expert can achieve, notably due to the consideration of information diversity.

The richness of differences allows a group to outperform. For Surowiecki, three ingredients must be present to reveal the intelligence of the crowd: 
- **Diversity**: having a large number of individuals from various backgrounds with original ideas. 
- **Independence of thought**: allowing each diverse opinion to express itself freely, without influence. 
- **Decentralization**: letting these different judgments freely combine rather than allowing a central authority, whether democratically elected or not, to determine the outcomes (Surowiecki, 2008, p. 54). The aggregation of diverse and varied information thus increases the capacity and power to act.

To illustrate his points, Surowiecki recounts an anecdote from statistician Francis Galton, who aimed to prove in 1906, during a competition at an English agricultural fair to guess the weight of an ox after it had been slaughtered and butchered, that a group of amateurs could not predict the result better than experts. Ultimately, Galton was significantly mistaken, as out of 787 guesses, the median total was 1,197 pounds, while the actual weight of the ox was 1,198 pounds, resulting in a remarkable accuracy of 10^-3 (Surowiecki, 2008, p. 62).

In a similar vein, a popular experiment involves asking students to guess how many marbles are in a filled jar. The average of all the responses is often very close to the true number and better than that of most individuals in the group, as the students' cognitive biases tend to compensate for each other to some extent.
