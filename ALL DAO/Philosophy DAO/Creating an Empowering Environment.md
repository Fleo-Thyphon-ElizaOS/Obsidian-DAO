**Empowerment**

This is why a DAO stands out as a powerful organizational lever, as everything that prevents a collective from reshaping its reality is essentially the centralization of the power to act, the capture of decision-making authority by an intermediary overseeing hierarchical levels.

The federated decentralization of individuals within a working collective serves as a key to “empowerment.” 

This notion of “empowerment,” as discussed at the beginning of the second section, refers to the enabling of individuals to develop their own capacity for action, both individually and collectively.

DAOs designed with a libertarian praxis establish an empowering environment, allowing individuals within the organization to develop their capacities and fostering a capability to cultivate skills, thus expanding the scope of possible actions for a collective. 

**Renormalization as a standard then becomes the mantra of the empowering structure of the DAO.**

# Developing Shared Rules
According to ergonomist Flore Barcellini, an empowering organization is "one that promotes the development of effective rules that support the creation of quality activity for operators [...] and organizational growth" (2015, p. 50).

Justine Arnoud describes an empowering organization as "instrumentalizable [...] offering a framework—an enabling structure—that provides resources and possibilities for each individual.” It is also a “debatable” organization, one that fosters “debate and confrontation of perspectives,” and finally, it’s an organization that is “conducive to defining collectives” (2013, pp. 139-140).

**The capacity to act, and thus to renormalize, are central here.**

A decentralized inter-autonomous organization, supported by the appropriate algorithmic infrastructure offered by the Aragon project (explored in 3.2.1), opens up an empowering environment.

The concept of an empowering environment stems from Amartya Sen’s “capabilities” approach. Sen, a Nobel-winning economist in welfare, defines capabilities as real abilities to convert resources into actual freedoms. This approach intersects with what individuals or groups are capable of doing and what their environment enables them to do. **In this framework, resources are transformed through “conversion factors” into tangible achievements (Sen, 1995).**

For Sen, capabilities are “the real freedoms to lead a life that one has reason to value” (Sen, 2004). This approach sheds light on action in context and activates skills, incorporating not only the individual but also the conditions and environment in which action takes place (Fernagu Oudet, 2012).

The capabilities approach has also been linked to the Care ethics proposed by Joan Tronto and Carol Gilligan. Care is “a generic activity that includes everything we do to maintain, perpetuate, and repair our ‘world,’ so that we can live in it as well as possible” (Tronto, 2009, p. 143).

# Ten Central Capabilities
Philosopher Martha Nussbaum lists ten central capabilities: life, bodily health, bodily integrity, senses (linked to imagination, creativity, and thought), emotions, practical reason, affiliation, other species, play, and control over one’s environment. Nussbaum sees these as the minimum required for human dignity (Nussbaum, 2012).

Furthermore, capabilities encourage collective synergy by fostering the capacity “to live with and for others, to recognize and be attentive to other human beings, and to engage in various types of social interactions; to imagine others’ situations. [...] To have the social basis for self-respect and non-humiliation; to be treated with dignity and recognized as having equal value to others” (Nussbaum, 2012, pp. 56-57).

This approach values social inclusion at all levels and promotes mutual understanding, enhancing cooperation. “Our evolutionary success lies in our ability to understand one another, to empathize and cooperate, and to perceive others’ emotions and intentions” (Gilligan, 2019, p. 19). Care, which can be understood as “solicitude,” meaning sustained and affectionate attention toward others, aligns well with Sen’s capabilities approach, directing the human collective, akin to a brotherhood, toward common well-being. This involves focusing on “attention to others,” “taking care,” “mutual care,” and concern for others (Brugère, 2011, p. 3), underscoring why it is crucial to “pay attention to voice (ensuring everyone has a voice and is heard)” and relationships (Gilligan, 2011, p. 37). Ensuring that everyone’s voice is heard is a principle of the web 3.0 libertarian praxis. By configuring Aragon to achieve egalitarian consensus, the environment becomes empowering.

In 2005, ergonomist Pierre Falzon expanded on the concept of an empowering environment by defining it as “an environment that allows individuals to develop new skills and knowledge, broadening their action possibilities, control over tasks, and autonomy in executing them” (2013).

In ergonomics, the notion of an empowering environment can be observed from three perspectives: 

1. **Preventive**: non-aggressive toward individuals, preserving their future action capabilities.
2. **Universal**: taking into account differences (anthropometry, age, gender, abilities, illness, etc.) to reduce inequalities and foster social inclusion and integration.
3. **Developmental**: promoting autonomy, efficiency, knowledge development, and new skills. This increases responsibility for one’s thoughts and actions while broadening action possibilities and task control (Falzon, 2005).

“When people consider themselves responsible for their ideas, they are also more likely to assume responsibility for their actions” (Nussbaum, 2011, p. 71).
