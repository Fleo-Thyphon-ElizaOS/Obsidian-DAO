Thus, holacracy suffers from a form of social alienation by denying the idiosyncratic uniqueness of individuals, as Robertson aptly states: “Holacracy is centered on the organization and its purpose—not on people, their desires, and their needs, however positive they may be” (2016, p. 224).

This is the limit of this system, which, according to our analysis, can only be libertarian in inspiration, not libertine.

Once the end of praxis is no longer praxis itself but poiésis, there is no longer libertarianism.

One must not confuse libertarianism with libertarianism, which, like liberalism, is an individualism based on private property advocating, in addition to the liberal vision, total individual freedom, emancipated from the State, while allowing for the economic domination of some over others.

Since in a finite world, more private property for some means less private property for others, thereby enabling an elite to thrive on rentier capitalism.

Liberals and libertarians see freedom as a sphere to be expanded; they both attempt to broaden their space of freedom towards nature or others, respecting the framework set by the law, which itself is influenced by neoliberalism.

In this paradigm, freedom is made of boundaries, limits to be pushed back or, conversely, not to be crossed. It is a selfish individualism that favors the rich at the expense of the poor and exacerbates unsustainable inequalities.

In contrast, libertarians do not view freedom as a separating and selfishly individualistic system but as a collective value based on living together and brotherhood. It is an altruistic individuation, where the freedom and uniqueness of each person become a means to turn towards others, accept their differences, cooperate, and help each other.

These limits are raised by Richard & Christi in their study conducted on this “new management system for a liquid world” (Bauman, 2013), where they conclude: “Ultimately, this system, which rejects interpersonal relationships and specifically human needs as giving life to its deep values, reduces the individual at work to a production agent and leads to the instrumentalization of their person for the exclusive benefit of the company's project” (2019, p. 262). Ultimately, one can say that “it is as if holacracy regards the individual at work as ‘interchangeable,’ ‘replaceable,’ even ‘disposable’” (Richard & Christin, 2019, p. 263). Thus, libertarian praxis is unthinkable within Robertson's holacracy. However, it could well be reshaped by collectives in a form far more libertarian than libertarian.

Indeed, as noted at the beginning of this section, the etymological definition of holacracy is close to organizational anarchism since the collective as praxis designated by holos, the whole, and self-determined by kratos, power, is in line with the ideal of social anarchism. But in a liberal or libertarian framework, swapping praxis and poiésis, the end is not the same; man falls to the rank of a tool serving the expansion of private property.

Moreover, Robertson did not call his system “Holocracy,” which would be etymologically more correct to refer to a power of the whole and of all, but “Holacracy,” in order to merge holarchy, hierarchy of holons, with kratos, rather than choosing holos, the entirety without any notion of hierarchy. Constructed this way, this neologism can only be antithetical to libertarian praxis since anarchy, by definition, rejects any type of arkhê, or command. That is why, inexorably, holacracy can only be excluded from organizational anarchy.

This clearly explains the dynamic of command through roles, holons, rather than through humans, who are then reduced to production agents only free within the confines of the contract. “The seat of power shifts from the person sitting at the top to a process” (Robertson, 2016, p. 36). By yielding his power to the regulatory system of the constitution he has ratified, the leader is thus absolved of the responsibility to maintain a system that alienates people in production. “Dialogue is reduced to its formal dimension, leaving very little room for the relational dimension. The system imagined by Brian Robertson relies on the formal distribution of power within the company rather than on cooperation among people aware of their positive interdependence” (Renié, 2020). This formal distribution of power, to the detriment of a real relational dimension, prevents thinking outside the conceptual framework of neoliberalism that confines individuals in the poiésis of boundaries stemming from private property. Consequently, one no longer sees in others a peer to connect with but rather a barrier delineating the individual as private property that must not be crossed.
