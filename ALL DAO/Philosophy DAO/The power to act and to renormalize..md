# Organizational Anarchy

Studies on organizational anarchy denounce the irrationality of decisions that are detached from the ground and the inappropriate solutions to problems by highlighting **“the impact on resistances of a delegation of decision-making power that is closer to the ground and activities”** (Ben Mansour, 2016).

# Ergology

In ergological language, we speak of the predominance of established knowledge **(academic knowledge)** over invested knowledge **(mobilized in the field)**.

This issue is addressed by the dynamic three-pole framework, which establishes a true **“two-way Socratic dialogue”**between the pole of established knowledge and the pole of invested knowledge through the **“values of humanity”**(Schwartz, 2002).

Indeed, without this essential dialogue between established knowledge and invested knowledge, operators are condemned to endure the greatest suffering at work, which can be the **“impeded work”** caused by heteronomy that mutilates both men and women in their bodies and their intelligence (Clot, 2015).

# Anarchy = Order - Power

Organizational anarchy, which therefore designates order minus power, seems to be a path worth exploring if one seeks to restore this vital autonomy to individuals. For _Georges Canguilhem_, heteronomy is a form of illness, as he considers that being ill equates to **the inability to act on one’s own living environment, or an inability to be normative.**

Canguilhem defines health as **“the ability to exceed the norm that defines the temporarily normal, the ability to tolerate violations of the usual norm and to establish new norms in new situations”** (2013, pp. 170-171).

Liberating oneself from any form of coercive power would allow for the recovery of full sovereignty over one's decision-making power and health.

One can thus use the term **“empowerment,”** literally meaning **“empowerment,”** a concept that emerged in the United States in the early 20th century, referring to both **autonomization, capacity building, and the learning process** to develop one's own ability to act, individually or collectively.

Empowerment breaks with intervention methods considered paternalistic, hierarchical, and unequal (Bacqué & Biewener, 2013, p. 13) and makes individuals more responsible.

When no one individually possesses power, it is distributed among equals.
