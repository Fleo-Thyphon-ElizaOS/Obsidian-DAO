As for whether it is possible to leave an organization without leadership to self-organize through an algorithmic consensus mechanism, or if it is impossible to imagine a completely decentralized organizational system functioning effectively, only experience can determine the answer.

Disruptive technologies such as blockchains serve as a true laboratory for revolutionizing the notion of governance.

With the new possibilities offered by decentralization, we will be able to rethink an anarchic model of organization.

To do this, we must seek solutions to our modern organizational problems, which these technologies provide interesting avenues for, and directly experience them.

"Investigation is the organic process of a being in search of its balance, the satisfaction of its need for nourishment, for example, in the case of hunger. Investigation is the organic and cultural approach of a being seeking the solution to the obscurity of its environment, its situation, at a specific moment in its development or, if you will, its history" (Dewey, 1967).

It is through trial and error that we verify the solidity of a theory.

That is why we will now focus on the case of the Bitcoin blockchain, which paved the way for the blockchain revolution in 2009. Bitcoin represents, to date, a more than positive experiment in decentralized autonomous organization, allowing over 80 million users worldwide to exchange financial value securely, without going through a bank. This facilitates financial inclusion for millions excluded from the banking system in regions of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

By understanding what the Bitcoin protocol achieves for financial value and how it does so, we will be able to consider what other protocols can similarly achieve regarding "organizational value" (Cappelletti & Khouatra, 2011), particularly through the implementation of smart contracts and the establishment of suitable consensus processes on a case-by-case basis.

The important thing will be to seize the opportunity for human collectives to use these technologies to benefit from the decentralization allowed by "trustless" systems that require no third party to carry out operations that previously required an intermediary.

The following pages may be somewhat technical, but the explanation of this technicality is crucial to understand how solid and resilient Bitcoin technology is and why, despite all the other blockchain technologies developing alongside the Bitcoin network, it continues to be one of the most secure decentralized consensus systems to date, if not the best.

A comparison with other consensus systems leading to decentralized governance, although not exhaustive due to their number, will also be made after studying the smart contracts that can enable such anarchic consensus.

Once we are informed about the technological aspect, we will explore the philosophical dimension by examining the key ideas of the anarchist movement that resonate with the tools of Web 3.0.
