The geographer and anarchist, _Élisée Reclus_, writes in his book, "Anarchy":  
**“Among equals, the work is more difficult, but it is higher: one must ardently seek the truth, find personal duty, learn to know oneself, continuously educate oneself, and act while respecting the rights and interests of comrades. Only then does one become a truly moral being; one is born to the feeling of responsibility”** (2009).

This assertion supports the Canguilhemian definition of health: **“I am well insofar as I feel capable of bearing the responsibility for my actions, of bringing things into existence, and of creating relationships among things that would not arise without me, but which would not be what they are without them”** (Canguilhem, 2002, p. 68).

# Freedom to Think = Unknowing Anarchists

Could Canguilhem, then, be an anarchist?  
There is no doubt in Reclus's eyes that freedom of thought makes all men **"unknowing anarchists."**

Reclus’s book also reflects on the ancient origins of anarchist principles, scientifically supported by anarchist anthropology, emphasizing that throughout time, there have been united men who collaborated in the birth of a society without masters, without official guardians of public morality, without jailers or executioners, without rich or poor but **brothers sharing their daily bread, maintaining cordial union, not through obedience to laws but through mutual respect.**

# The Market Law in Our Lives

It is customary to recall that this ancient freedom of spirit, inherent to our anarchist nature, is **antithetical to that of the market**, which appropriates the anarchic tendency of organization to stimulate workers toward “hyper-individualization,” controlling “the definition of politics as well as the structuring of thought and opinion” (Chomsky, 2003, p. 18).

This market incentive toward selfish individualism, diametrically opposed to the altruistic individuation of libertarianism, implies social atomization, dividing men from one another and preventing them from coalescing, thereby transforming them into docile instruments of production.

Self-management and autonomy, often claimed today in the workplace and political life, represent the unexpected realization, in a capitalist regime, of an old libertarian idea long considered a utopian dream. Yet if the concepts remain true to their definition, **their more financial than human end severely betrays the original utopia.**

How can we not see in the semantic travesty of anarchy into anomie a desire to reduce freedom of thought to chaos in order to impose the singular vision that the neoliberal ideology has of freedom, which is limited to market liberalization?

# Origin of Anarchy

The origin of the term “anarchy” as a philosophical and political concept, as addressed in this thesis, begins with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who first declared in 1840:  
**“Although very fond of order, I am, in every sense of the word, an anarchist.”**

Until then, this term had a pejorative connotation; its meaning was negative, synonymous with chaos, disorder, or absence of government, as evidenced by the article "Anarchy" in André Lalande's great vocabulary of philosophy, which defines anarchy as **disorder, absence of authority or organization.** This definition has been modified to account for Marsal’s observation, which rightly pointed out that this definition could imply that the exercise of authority is “the necessary and sufficient condition for order,” while disorder can have other causes than the absence of authority.

Moreover, **“order can, in certain cases, establish itself spontaneously.”** Marsal adds that the anarchy as defined by Lalande’s article does not exist and that disorder, when it occurs, **is never the effect of a lack of authority;** it is often the effect of that authority, whose pretensions create or increase disorder, particularly when it is coercive.

Marsal thus aligns with Élisée Reclus, who thought of anarchy as **“the highest expression of order”** (Préposiet, 2005, p. 83).

# Anarchy in Everyday Life

For [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], anarchy is the political ideal of the modern world. **“Society seeks order in anarchy. Anarchy, absence of masters, of sovereigns, such is the form of government to which we are approaching every day”** (Proudhon, 2012, p. 242).  
On this point, Proudhon was remarkably avant-garde, as evidenced by the alternative forms of work organization such as _liberated, deliberate, humanistic, evolutionary, opalescent, appreciative, or holacracy_ companies, each seeking to **“free”**employees by offering them greater autonomy and minimizing the weight of hierarchy to its strict minimum, if it must remain, in order to bring about “happiness at work” (Renié, 2020).

It is always astonishing to see how our own unconscious anarchist tendencies assert themselves **in daily life**, in the workplace or simply in our social interactions, without **our being able to discern and accept them for what they are**.

The alternative forms of organization factually prove to us, better than Élisée Reclus could, that an anarchist sleeps, at least in part, in each of us.

Sébastien Faure, in his anarchist encyclopedia, asserts: **“There are several varieties of anarchists, but all share a common trait that separates them from all other human varieties. This common point is the negation of the principle of authority in social organization and the hatred of all constraints that stem from institutions based on this principle. Thus, anyone who denies and fights authority is an anarchist”** (Faure, 1920). One must understand in this negation of the principle of authority an authority deemed illegitimate due to the coercion it imposes.
