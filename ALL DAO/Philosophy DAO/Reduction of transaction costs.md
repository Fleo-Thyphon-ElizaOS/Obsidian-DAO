### Transaction Costs

Nobel Prize-winning economist Ronald Coase defines transaction costs as the costs associated with the coordination between agents.

#### Types of Transaction Costs

1. **Costs Related to Uncertainty**: These costs involve the need for an agent to gather information before making an economic transaction. This may include researching and collecting data relevant to the transaction.

2. **Costs Associated with Negotiation**: This includes costs related to negotiating and drafting contracts, prospecting, and the time and effort spent negotiating and verifying a transaction, among others.

### Agreeing on Rules
“When one wishes to conduct a transaction in a market, it is necessary to find the contractor or contractors, provide them with the necessary information, set the contract conditions, conduct negotiations to establish a genuine market, conclude the contract, and establish a control structure for the parties' respective obligations” (Coase, 2005, p. 23).

DAOs can reduce or eliminate these transaction costs, along with those related to hierarchical organization, such as management and human resource management, thanks to their smart contracts, which execute automatically without the need for third-party intervention.

Unlike a corporation, a DAO does not require a board of directors to implement a voted decision; it is automatically applied by smart contracts and is irreversible. The only remaining transaction cost within a DAO is that associated with collective voting.

### Risks of Voting
However, risks persist due to the very nature of these digital tools, which can be potentially subject to **cyberattacks**, as illustrated by the example of TheDAO in section 1.3.3. A significant hacking incident cannot be ruled out; nevertheless, it can serve the antifragility of the system, as the flaw in TheDAO’s program was corrected by the Ethereum community, although it led to a schism within it.

### Hormesis Law
According to the law of hormesis, what does not kill a blockchain makes it stronger. The Ethereum community learned from this mistake by voting to modify the code, whereas the classic Ethereum community that arose from this schism voted for the immutability of the code. Ultimately, the division can be reduced to a disagreement over a simple question: whether "the intent of the code" should prevail over "the literal meaning of the code" (De Filippi, 2018).

In contrast to legal code, where the law is subject to interpretation by a judge who may overlook the literal meaning of the law if its blind application violates the initial intent of the legislator, computer code is written in **a strict and formalized language** designed solely for the cases it addresses, making it rigid without human intervention.
