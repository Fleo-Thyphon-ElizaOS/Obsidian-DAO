Anarchism seeks to resolve this Tocquevillian aporia between freedom and equality by completely abolishing the state, which, regardless of the level of decentralization in a market society, **uniformizes the crowds**.

Decentralization without a state thus becomes the stronghold of social anarchism, which relies solely on the morality of the members of the larger human community to govern responsible relationships together, **contrary** to representative democracy, which disempowers individuals by depriving them of any participation outside of elections.

# Free Morality Among Anarchists

According to Pierre Kropoktine, morality is a "science" that dictates to the free individual their duty. It serves to enhance themselves and improve the environment in which they live.

In anarchist morality, Kropotkine argues that the anarchist possesses a morality free from oppressive obligations and repressive sanctions, based on mutual aid and the fraternity of all human groups.

This morality is unique in that it commands nothing, absolutely refuses to mold the individual according to an abstract idea, and rejects mutilation by law, government, or religion. This morality aims to grant full and complete freedom to the individual (Kropotkine, 2004, p. 2).

**The ultimate goal for Kropotkine is for man to regain inner peace, which is the supreme pleasure.**

This morality aligns perfectly with the type of society promoted by social anarchism:

- A society without a state
- Directly managed by individuals and social groups in a completely decentralized manner, where the rule is the economic and social equality of all individuals
- Collective or individual ownership of the means of production and distribution, excluding any possibility for some to live off the labor of others
- The abolition of wage labor and the system of exploitation of man by man.

Social anarchism does not claim to change human nature; it simply aspires to a **better education of the individual** so that they may know themselves better and be truly free from the slavery induced by their desires, allowing for a healthier and richer conception of relationships between them and their peers to emerge from society.

Anarchists aim to be both revolutionary and evolutionary; for them, evolution precedes revolution and does so cyclically.

It is the intensity of solidarity that allows humanity to evolve from one revolution to the next.

**From drawings to writing and printing, from agriculture to industry and digital technology, from horseback travel to cars and planes and rockets, from metallic currency to paper money and cryptocurrencies... etc.**

None of this would have been possible without the incredible richness of singular individualities connected to give rise to **trans-subjective and intersubjective** dimensions—the quintessence of collective intelligence.

Anarchism primarily values individuation so that each person, by expressing their idiosyncrasy, can solidarily offer the best of themselves to their peers for co-evolution. Natural mutual aid, according to Pierre Kropoptine is a factor of evolution that is as, if not more, important than the laws of "the struggle for existence" and "natural selection" in Darwinism Charles Darwin 

"Animal species in which individual struggle has been minimized and where the practice of mutual aid has reached its greatest development are invariably more numerous, more prosperous, and more open to progress" (2005, p. 62).

This conception of evolution is in total opposition to the mercantile laws of competition; while neoliberalism essentially promotes the race for private property, libertarian morality, on the contrary, encourages the expansion of life in a selfless spirit of cooperation and common ownership.

The former encourages individuals to carve out a larger share of the pie, while the latter incentivizes agents to enlarge the size of this collective pie. While it may not be possible to instill anarchist philosophy in the minds of men, it is, however, possible through the internet of value to direct virtuous behaviors in this direction.

This is indeed the intent of the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin to restore to the monetary dimension its aspect as a common good.
