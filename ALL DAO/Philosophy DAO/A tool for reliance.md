But why then go through a digital application rather than resolving everything directly in person through democratic and collegial means?

In an assembly exchange where many actors must find consensus, it can sometimes be difficult to agree, as ideas from different individuals can fly in all directions, and it can also be challenging to assert oneself and one's ideas in the face of individuals who may have a presence that can overshadow others, consciously or unconsciously.

The political dimension is such that within a group, some individuals, being more charismatic or better orators, can manipulate the assembly.

Therefore, having the ability to express one's voice in a calm manner through an application, weighing the pros and cons of one’s decision as well as the feedback from peers on that decision, could be more efficient. This would further encourage workers to actively participate.

This does not exclude the possibility of organizing discussion spaces or work research groups (EDT or GRT) in advance to strengthen collective agency from a perspective of discussion engineering (Detchessahar, 2013, p. 57).

Direct communication remains the cornerstone of the salutogenesis of a collective; the construction of workplace health depends on the quality of communication dynamics surrounding work.

Nonetheless, the option of indirect decision-making facilitated by DAO tools remains an interesting complementary solution that would be a shame to overlook.

Enhancing the quality of dialogue among collective agents can occur both directly through EDT or GRT and indirectly through digital interfaces that allow company stakeholders to express their views asynchronously.

Making decisions outside the influence of others allows individuals to vote while expressing their uniqueness and preserving it from any alteration by peers that could distort it.

The goal of the libertarian praxis that animates organizational anarchy is to collaborate with one another while respecting the principle of individuation, which recognizes each being as singular.

Individuation is inherently relational; philosopher Gilbert Simondon speaks of inter-individuation, extending to the trans-individual, which he defines as "a social becoming that individuates into a collective unit" (2002). Humans transcend themselves through relationships with their peers.

For Bernard Stiegler, "the trans-individual is what, through the diachronic co-individuation of 'I's, engenders the synchronizing trans-individuation of a 'we'" (2012, p. 122). This highlights the importance of establishing an egalitarian consensus within a work collective. In a company, the collective is unified; it is the aggregation of all singular individuations that gives identity to the collective unit that is the human organization of the company.

From this perspective, Aragon provides a powerful organizational lever to make corporate governance more democratic, allowing the individuals that comprise it to interact in a way that is much more attentive to everyone’s voice, thereby enabling them to "inter-be."

This notion of inter-being was developed by Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh, who wrote: "If you are a poet, you will clearly see a cloud floating in this piece of paper. Without the cloud, there would be no rain; without rain, the trees would not grow; and without trees, we could not make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to be here in front of us. Without the cloud, there is no sheet of paper. Thus, it is possible to say that the cloud and the sheet of paper 'inter-are.' The word 'inter-being' is not yet in the dictionary, but by combining the prefix 'inter' and the verb 'to be,' we create a new verb, inter-be. Without the cloud, we would not have paper; we can thus say that the cloud and the sheet of paper inter-are" (1990). Inter-being with one’s peers elevates individuals beyond the whole and its parts.

How can we not then think of Edgar Morin's notion of "reliance"? "Any perspective on ethics must perceive that the moral act is an individual act of reliance: reliance with another, reliance with a community, with society, and, ultimately, reliance with the human species" (2004, p. 16). "At the highest level of complexity, reliance can only be love" (p. 40). Reliance as love transcending complexity represents a true metanoia.

Whether philosopher, sociologist, or Buddhist monk, humanity always arrives at the same conclusion: it is the relationship with the other that enables humanity to move towards its own metanoia, a transcendence of self towards a higher self, an evolution from a precarious state to one of abundance.
