This is why algorithmic automation, arising from egalitarian consensus within a group, becomes a significant lever for preserving the inter-autonomy of the collective. This automation must be the result of dynamic and evolving self-governance, akin to Frédéric Laloux's concept of the "evolutionary teal organization," which must grow organically.

"Self-governing organizations are not structured by the pursuit of power through hierarchical models of Newtonian science. They are complex, participatory, interconnected, interdependent, and continuously evolving systems, like natural ecosystems" (Laloux, 2015, p. 197). To approach these complex systems, Laloux calls for a paradigm shift—a *metanoia*—that is essential for establishing such an organization, one that stands in contrast to all hierarchical forms of organization we currently know.

In section 2.4.3, we saw that this paradigm shift, inherent to blockchains, already allows us to move beyond waiting and hoping for a collective paradigm shift in the human psyche by creating a DAO for the collective. Disintermediating transactions and automating governance dynamically enables a response to modern complexity through an interconnected, continuously evolving inter-autonomy. Some argue that these digital technologies diminish the quality of human interactions, yet, in observable reality, the opposite is happening. Milad Doueihi, to illustrate this technological hybridization, speaks of a *digital humanism*.

"We are accustomed to saying that language somehow defines humanity. However, it seems to me, following urbanists and also the founding myths of our cultures, that what defines humans is also their way of shaping and inhabiting space. Digital humanism, for me, expresses this virtual urbanism, this relationship, conveyed by architecture, of humans to their environment, of boundaries and thresholds, of spaces reserved for worship and intimacy, for knowledge and its transmission—in short, spaces marked by uses, inhabited by practices, and imbued with symbolic and aesthetic values. In this context, the digital realm establishes the hybrid as the culmination of our culture: it represents, quite simply, the triumph of the hybrid, yet a hybrid that defines new landscapes, a new economy, and introduces new benchmarks and new criteria" (Doueihi, 2011).
