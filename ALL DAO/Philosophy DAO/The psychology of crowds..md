What governs men are ideas, feelings, and morals, things that reside within ourselves. Institutions and laws are manifestations of our soul, expressions of its needs. Arising from this soul, institutions and laws cannot change it.

One can compare observable phenomena to waves that translate the subterranean upheavals occurring beneath the surface of the ocean, which we do not know. When observed in most of their acts, crowds often display a notably inferior mentality; yet there are other acts where they seem guided by those mysterious forces that the ancients called fate, nature, providence, which we call the voices of the dead, and whose power we cannot ignore, even if we are unaware of their essence.

In nature, beings solely driven by instinct perform actions of wonderful complexity that astonish us. Reason is still too new in humanity and too imperfect to reveal the laws of the unconscious, let alone replace them. In all our actions, the role of the unconscious is immense.

The memorable events of history are the visible effects of the invisible changes in human thought. If these great events manifest so rarely, it is because there is nothing more stable in a race than the hereditary foundation of its thoughts.

While all our ancient beliefs falter and disappear, while the old pillars of societies collapse one after the other, the power of the crowds is the only force that remains unthreatened and whose prestige continues to grow. The age we are entering will truly be the ERA OF CROWDS.

However, if individuals in a crowd merely pooled the ordinary qualities of which each has a share, there would be merely an average, and not, as we have said, the creation of new characters.

Various causes determine the appearance of these special characteristics among crowds that isolated individuals do not possess. The first is that the individual in a crowd acquires, simply by the fact of being numerous, a feeling of invincible power that allows them to yield to instincts they would have necessarily restrained alone. They will be even less inclined to restrain them since the crowd is anonymous and, therefore, irresponsible; the feeling of responsibility that always holds individuals back disappears entirely.

A second cause, contagion, also intervenes to determine the manifestation of special characteristics in crowds and their orientation at the same time. Contagion is a phenomenon easy to observe but not explained, and it must be linked to hypnotic phenomena that we will examine shortly. In a crowd, every feeling, every act is contagious, and so contagious that the individual easily sacrifices their personal interest for the collective interest. This is a capacity quite contrary to their nature, and of which a person is rarely capable unless they are part of a crowd.

From the above, we conclude that the crowd is always intellectually inferior to the isolated man, but from the perspective of feelings and the acts these feelings provoke, it can, depending on circumstances, be better or worse. Everything depends on how the crowd is suggested. This is what writers who have only studied crowds from a criminal point of view have completely misunderstood. The crowd is often criminal, no doubt, but it is also often heroic. It is especially crowds that are led to be killed for the triumph of a belief or idea, who are enthused for glory and honor, who are urged almost without bread and weapons as in the age of the Crusades, to deliver the tomb of a God from the infidel, or as in '93, to defend the soil of the homeland. These are somewhat unconscious heroisms, no doubt, but it is with such heroisms that history is made. If only the great actions, coolly reasoned, were credited to peoples, the annals of the world would record very few.

One sometimes wonders, upon reading, at the weakness of certain speeches that nonetheless had a huge influence on the crowds that listened to them; but one forgets that they were made to lead collectives, not to be read by philosophers. The orator, in intimate communication with the crowd, knows how to evoke images that seduce them. If he succeeds, his goal has been achieved; and twenty volumes of harangues—always crafted afterward—are worth far less than the few phrases that reached the minds he needed to convince.

Sometimes, however, the feelings suggested by images are so strong that they tend, like habitual suggestions, to transform into acts. Many stories have been told of the popular theater that, only playing dark dramas, had to protect the actor who played the traitor from the violence of the audience, indignant at the crimes, imaginary yet, that this traitor had committed. I believe this is one of the most remarkable indicators of the mental state of crowds, and especially of the ease with which they are suggested. The unreal has almost as much action on them as the real. They have an obvious tendency not to differentiate between the two.

Therefore, it is not the facts themselves that strike the popular imagination, but the way they are distributed and presented. They must, by their condensation, if I may express it this way, produce a striking image that fills and obsesses the mind. Who knows the art of impressing the imagination of crowds also knows the art of governing them.
