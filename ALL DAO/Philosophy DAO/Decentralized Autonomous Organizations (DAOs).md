Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs (the English acronym for "Decentralized Autonomous Organization"), are decentralized organizations whose governance rules are automated by code and inscribed immutably and transparently on a blockchain. They represent a form of incorruptible organization owned by the individuals who helped create and finance them, with publicly available rules. This system is "trustless," meaning there is no need to trust anyone to conduct secure transactions; everything is encoded, and this code is auditable and even modifiable by anyone.

DAOs are essentially programmed using one or more smart contracts (SCs), primarily deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, and their operation today largely resembles that of a decentralized venture capital fund.

Governed by a computer program that provides automated governance rules to a community, a DAO is an entity whose rules, voted on by the interested collective, are inscribed immutably and transparently on a blockchain. This technology, as a reminder, is a secure method of storing and transmitting information that operates without a central controlling authority.
