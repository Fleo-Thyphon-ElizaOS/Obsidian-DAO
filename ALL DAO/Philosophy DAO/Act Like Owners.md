### Act Like Owners

Ownership is extremely influential when it comes to DAO culture.

Not only does it encourage individuals to participate, but it fundamentally changes how contributors perceive their efforts and work. All work is rooted in the pursuit of a broader goal, with benefits shared among participants. Ownership infuses a sense of creation, success, and _vibes_. It’s natural for an owner to feel more financially and psychologically motivated to support their peers, uplift the work of others, set aside ego, and give their best than a traditional worker would.

Jesse Walden, the co-founder of investment firm Variant, has been particularly insightful on this topic. In his essay, "[TheOwnership Economy](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://variant.fund/writing/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software)," Walden notes:

As the individual’s role in value creation becomes more common, the next evolutionary step is towards software that is not only built, operated, and funded by individual users but also owned by users.

DAOs are, in a sense, precisely this type of “software.” They elevate the individual and give users a chance to contribute and take ownership. It’s powerful.
