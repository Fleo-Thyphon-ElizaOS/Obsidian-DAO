**Unlike a pathogenic type of organization, an egalitarian consensus within a decentralized collective governance seeks to create a “salutogenic organizational world” where concern and care for others synergize with individual fulfillment and social performance, leading to an economically resilient organization.**

This salutogenic organization of work “aims to serve the construction of a work world where the well-being of all is more precious than individual gain” (Deliaune, 2015, p. 537). In a decentralized autonomous organization, autonomy “does not mean independence but interdependence, ‘organic solidarity’ toward a greater whole” (Yves Schwartz, 1998, p. 49).

### Human Engagement in the Pursuit of Meaning

The libertarian praxis is also an organic solidarity, a drive for individual and collective self-improvement that enables the self-body to affirm itself as an individual and fulfill its essentially relational individuation, fostering connection and inter-autonomy within a collective. As Joëlle Zask reminds us, humans are “hybrid beings, as much autonomous and solitary as socially existing and dependent, bound by what is alternately called ‘well-being’ and friendship” (2011, p. 29).

The need to create meaning, inherent to the self-body, is never realized in isolation but rather in interdependence and participation with peers. By “taking part,” “contributing their share,” and “receiving their share,” people “engage in a historical process of contributing to the search for a suitable truth for those present” (Zask, 2011, p. 318).

As a collective evolves, members reach mutual agreement, enriching each other with the diversity each brings. Again, “removing the contributive dimension from existence is removing humanity” (Zask, 2011, p. 166). Humanity co-creates its history with its peers, **building with others what would be impossible to achieve alone. The world is, regardless of liberal or libertarian beliefs, fundamentally a shared world.**

David Cooperrider, a sociologist of organizations, explains this principle of social constructionism by emphasizing that “human knowledge and the destiny of organizations are intertwined. We are constantly involved in understanding and constructing meaning about people and the world around us…To be effective, leaders, managers, and change agents must master the art of understanding, reading, and analyzing organizations as human constructions” (2016, pp. 105-106).

This constructionist approach aligns with Lévi-Strauss’s structuralism, which views social reality as a formal set of relations. With these perspectives, the collective dimension of meaning-making becomes indispensable. Only efficient communication dynamics can guide a collective toward a suitable organizational structure.

### DAO and Constructionism

DAOs, through increased interactions that allow anyone to create referendums and vote, enhance communication and dialogic spaces and deepen connections among members, thus strengthening inter-autonomy. The libertarian praxis of Web 3.0 shares constructionism's goal, as it “replaces definitive and unyielding assertions with a continuous collaborative quest to understand and create options for a better life” (Cooperrider & Whitney, 2016, p. 106).

This better life, unquantifiable and thus without value in neoliberal quantophrenia, is part of what **Yves Schwartz** calls “dimensionless values,” as “unlike outcome assessments or quantitative evaluations of productivity or profitability, dimensionless values like health, justice, well-being, and harmonious living cannot be encapsulated in a precise, stable definition that allows compartmentalization. Nor can they be subject to a unit of measurement that enables comparison” (2009, p. 17). These dimensionless values guide human action in a co-creationist, collective constructionism. “If dimensionless values exist, it’s to bring about a common world” (p. 19).

Thus, the libertarian organization of work that blockchains enable allows for the reappropriation of the self-body by reclaiming commons and, specifically, the political power space within the commons (Ostrom, 2010).

By creating their own protocols and tokens, DAOs foster emancipatory freedom from market alienation, decentralizing collective intelligence that solidifies a process of responsibility within a connected, interdependent collective, each inter-autonomous in co-constructing the environment they grow within.

In this way, the global performance of companies, inherently multidimensional, becomes more accessible to all stakeholders, whose agency and autonomy are preserved through the normalization of their capacity to reframe their reality.
