**A DAO Differentiates Itself from a Traditional Entity in Three Ways:**

- First, no person or organization can control it because **only the smart contract (SC) can define the organization’s rules** and hold the group’s treasury; only a vote can change the code, as illustrated in 1.2 with TheDAO example.
- Second, it cannot be stopped or closed.
- Finally, it is fully auditable and transparent on a supranational level, as its operating rules are public, independent of any legal jurisdiction, and entirely reliant on open-source code (a program designed to be publicly accessible and, thus, evolving).

If a malicious attempt is made to misappropriate funds outside of what the SC covers, it cannot succeed. For example, if the treasury is managed by an SC, no one can spend the funds without approval (through a vote) nor alter the organization’s structure.

**DAOs Do Not Require Central Authority.**

The group makes decisions collectively, and payments are authorized automatically when votes are in favor.

This is made possible by the transparency of open-source software: since everything is public, it is impossible to modify the code (the rules of a DAO) without being noticed. This renders SCs unbreakable once deployed on an infrastructure blockchain like Ethereum.

### Ethereum Blockchain
Ethereum has the advantage of enjoying strong trust from both investors and DAO project creators due to its distributed and well-established consensus, which organizations trust. Furthermore, the Ethereum community has proven to be more collaborative than competitive, allowing best practices to integrate into Ethereum’s blockchain and support systems to emerge quickly, making it antifragile.

### Advantages of a DAO
The benefits of a DAO for its users include significantly reducing the likelihood of conflicts within a collective, drastically increasing security levels and autonomy through unbreakable blockchain technology, and maintaining an ideal power balance for optimal resource allocation and sound decision-making.

### Code is Law
Moreover, the decentralization of these autonomous organizations makes them unaffiliated with any particular nation-state. Only the code is law within a DAO running on a blockchain infrastructure where the SC leaves no room for interpretation, ensuring its immutability and autonomous operation by removing a central decision-making entity.

### Collective Decision-Making
The structure of a DAO indeed creates an environment where no one is a CEO individually, but **everyone is a CEO collectively.** This amplifies the impact of collective decisions and enables the achievement of common goals. A DAO can:
- Generate payroll with automatically paid salaries,
- Incorporate an autonomous human resources management system,
- Automate an accounting system,
- Enable systemic voting, among other functions.

This presents a tremendous opportunity for companies where the management costs of such support functions are significant for human and financial resources, while also steering stakeholder relationships toward **a sharing economy and interconnected services.** In an increasingly globalized world, with ever-multiplying connections and interactions across the entire supply chain from producer to end customer, gaining efficiency and reducing transaction costs related to assessing trust in a new potential partner can only be achieved through a trustless system.

**Most transaction costs are attributable to the time spent establishing this trust.**
