### Weakness of Demand

Some believe that the technological leap enabled by blockchain technology is such that there is first a significant need for public understanding and appropriation.

It must also be acknowledged that numerous scandals marked the early years of blockchain technology:

- **Ponzi Schemes**: These investment schemes involve new entrants paying the returns of earlier investors until there are no more new entrants, causing the pyramid to collapse like a house of cards.
- **Theft from Individual Investors**: Dishonest entrepreneurs exploited fake or empty projects, particularly through the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) mechanism, allowing the issuance of a token and setting an initial sale price, enabling any consumer to invest without restriction (absence of qualified investor definitions), without oversight (at the time) from financial regulatory authorities, and without advice from specialized firms (in investments, placements, and portfolio management).
- **Theft of Cryptoassets Linked to Exchanges**: Due to the cybersecurity risks associated with the centralization of client data (within their servers), exchanges experienced hacks leading to the theft of cryptocurrencies stored in wallets managed by exchanges rather than by their clients.
- **High-Profile Exchange Failures**: A notable example is Mt. Gox, which, in 2014, was the largest exchange in the world in terms of volume managed on its platform and the amounts deposited by its customers. This scandal, linked to the previous point about centralized data hacks, also stemmed from the absence of regulation for such operators at the time. No serious Know Your Customer (KYC) or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures were adopted by these actors. In the case of Mt. Gox, the theft of 744,408 bitcoins precipitated the exchange's spectacular downfall, leaving it unable to reimburse its customers and leading to the arrest and conviction of its CEO, Frenchman Mark Karpelès, in Japan.
- **Doubtful and/or Illegal Uses of Technology**: One example is the Silk Road scandal, named after the illegal drug sales service on the dark web (the submerged face of the Internet or uncensored Internet), where dealers quickly realized the benefits of secure transactions conducted outside the banking system, guaranteeing a certain degree of anonymity (though not true anonymity in the case of Bitcoin). The sale and payment for illegal goods using cryptocurrencies (mainly Bitcoin, but also Zcash or Monero) allowed this site to experience considerable growth until its closure and the arrest/conviction of its founder, Ross Ulbricht.
- **Recent Rug Pull Scams**: These occur when the liquidity of a protocol is siphoned off by a hacker, leaving holders with a cryptocurrency that has no value.

While these examples represent only a snapshot of the market from some time ago, it is understandable that they may have long affected investor confidence and even more so the entry of institutional actors into the blockchain ecosystem. However, things are changing, and the recent public listing of Coinbase indicates a general paradigm shift in the perception of the crypto universe.

### Weakness of Supply

The supply remains relatively limited, not very diverse, and not well-structured. Thus, there is a problem both at the quantitative level (limited and not diverse) and at the qualitative level (not diverse and poorly structured). There are still no standards or processes, let alone strong legal frameworks and established case law. This market lacks maturation in technical, functional, and legal terms. These shortcomings are largely due to the high level of technicality that prevents many actors from engaging with the subject intelligently and effectively, as evidenced by some often anxious statements from French economic authorities (AMF, Banque de France, Ministry of Economy) on the matter.

This is also why we find ourselves together in this program.

### Indicators of Market Immaturity

The result is a blurry, opaque market, in which certain practices reflect the absence of clear legislation regarding the blockchain industry, which, hopefully, will not last. There have been many questionable behaviors from unscrupulous actors (empty projects, lacking real added value, dubious use of raised funds) and even condemnable actions (Ponzi schemes, fraudulent ICOs, blatant theft). The repeated scandals that have plagued the industry during its first ten years and the responses that virtuous actors within the ecosystem are attempting to provide aim to fully unleash the potential of this technology and facilitate its mainstream adoption.

However, these issues primarily reflected the market's immaturity, which had not yet introduced any major innovations, apart from Bitcoin for the banking and financial system.

What Ethereum blockchain enables—namely, the creation of decentralized applications (dApps), and particularly in terms of decentralized finance (DeFi)—finally brings real innovations and applications to this technology.

A few blockchains other than Bitcoin and Ethereum have made their mark in terms of market capitalization, such as Polkadot, Elrond, or Ripple. However, they have not scaled in terms of industrial applications, and their offered functionalities are not yet fully mature on a technical level. It is essential to be forgiving towards these latter ones (except for Ripple) and to remember the early days of the Internet and the hesitations that accompanied them.

It is, however, more alarming to note that the vast majority of other blockchains are often, at best, pale copies of the sector's leaders (e.g., BSC) or, at worst, mere marketing products riding the wave of enthusiasm for an innovative technology (e.g., Tron).
