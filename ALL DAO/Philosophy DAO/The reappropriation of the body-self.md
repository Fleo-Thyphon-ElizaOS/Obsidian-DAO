This alienation, stemming from the fetishization of capital that “heteronomously embeds citizens viscerally and molecularly with a multitude of psychotic anxieties” under neoliberalism (Nots, 2005), obstructs the development of the body-self.

To recall the definition of this ergological conceptual tool mentioned in the preamble, the body-self represents “**an embodied subject where psyche and soma are integrated through the coherence established between each person and their environment, between individual life and social life**” (Schwartz, 2009, p. 34).

# Definition

This concept reflects the subjective dimension of work: “all work, because it is a site of challenge, calls for a use of the self. This means that it is not simply an act of execution but a usage—a summoning of someone singular with capacities far beyond those merely required by the task” (2009, p. 260).

# The Nature of Work

This continual call to human uniqueness engaged in every task highlights that work cannot simply be a mechanical execution of instructions set by others. Work is a use of oneself by oneself and by others within the framework of **a goal to achieve, a result to obtain, a task to perform, always within a situation that, to varying degrees, remains specific and unpredictable. For it is human nature to employ one's adaptability to their environment.**

Without this “use of oneself” by oneself and others, no work can be accomplished.

However, strict adherence to a prescribed task leads to production paralysis, as there is an inherent gap between the prescribed and the actual that every active subject adds to the initial prescription.

Psychiatrist Christophe Dejours does not speak of a gap between prescribed and actual work but of a gap **between prescribed work and effective work.** For him, the real is “that which reveals itself as resistance to technical control or even to knowledge” (2009, p. 27). Thus, no task can be performed by a human without being uniquely reinterpreted.
