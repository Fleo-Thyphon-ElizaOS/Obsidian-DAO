### Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

According to the libertarian Mikhail Bakunin, drawing on the insights of Alexis de Tocqueville, the state socialism he envisioned would lead to a dictatorship, a form of despotism (Onfray, 2017, p. 125).

### Representative Democracy

Bakunin argued, aligning with Tocqueville on representative democracy, that as long as workers **remain economically dominated by a capitalist minority**, universal suffrage will only be the surest means of making the masses cooperate in the construction of their own prison (Bakunin, 2012). 

The primary distinction between political liberal philosophers and social anarchists lies in their conception of the individual and freedom.

### Liberal Perspective

In the liberal conception, the social contract is based on the model of private property, and liberals view the individual as pre-existing society, which is seen as a contract among free individuals. In this perspective, the freedom of one stops where the freedom of another begins.

### Libertarian Perspective

Conversely, in the libertarian view, the individual is inherently a social being. The more free an individual is, the more social relationships they have, making freedom a relational characteristic rather than an individual property. 

**Cooperation with others does not limit an individual's freedom but rather enhances it by increasing their capacity to act.**

### Philosophy of Social Anarchy

This notion of enhancing one another can be traced to the Latin root of authority, *augere*, as discussed in the previous section. Thus, it is not unreasonable for the philosophical current of social anarchism to speak of **the natural authority of men augmenting one another through cooperation**.

Pierre-Joseph Proudhon introduces the idea of "collective force" to denote this human synergy and social bond, which is based not only on utility but also on the creation of moral relationships rooted in solidarity (Bourgeois, 2006, p. 119).

Bakunin, without explicitly naming collective force, asserts that **"work is the only fundamental basis of dignity and human rights."** Thus, the collective dimension is heavily emphasized within the libertarian current of anarchism.

### The Place of Man for His Freedom

This universal socialist tendency is evident long before Proudhon, among thinkers like the Cynics, Rabelais, and La Boétie, who can be seen as **precursors of anarchism** by viewing it as an inherent tendency of human personality, present throughout history and in all societies.

In his preface to the *Phenomenology of Spirit*, Hegel argues that "the truth is the whole" (Hegel, 2006). Similarly, for anarchists, regardless of their current, the truth is the individual, the singular, the "unique" (Stirner, 2000). 

In the dialogical relationship between the whole and its parts, the universal and the particular, the essential moment is not defined by totality. The true essence of things resides within each unique being. In other words, "Man is nature becoming aware of itself" (Reclus, 2017).

For the Hegelian philosopher Max Stirner, only individuality gives meaning to freedom. Stirner's notion of freedom is secondary to individuality. Anarchist ethics resides in **the affirmation of one’s own individuality** and the deployment of one's idiosyncratic singularity.

This is why any delegation of popular will equates to an alienation of freedom. For Emmanuel Kant, the inevitable functional hierarchy of representative democracies introduces new forms of inequality, as citizens' political will must constantly manifest through proxies, which he considers a form of despotism (2001, pp. 86-87).

### Universal Suffrage

This is why Élisée Reclus wrote in his letter to Jean Grave on September 26, 1885, regarding universal suffrage that "to vote is to abdicate. Appointing one or more masters for a short or long period is to renounce one's own sovereignty. Whether they become absolute monarchs, constitutional princes, or simply agents armed with a little royalty, the candidate you elevate to the throne or chair will be your superior. You are naming men who are above the law, as they draft it and their mission is to make you obey." In this case, the citizen is part of society but without actively participating (Zask, 2011, p. 17).

This encroachment on individual sovereignty is equally unacceptable from the perspective of the libertarian humanist Élisée Reclus and from Tocqueville’s liberal viewpoint: "Everywhere [in Europe], people are emerging from the freedom of the Middle Ages, not to enter modern freedom, but to return to **ancient despotism**. For centralization is nothing but the administration of a modernized Roman Empire" (Reverso, 2009). However, only the refusal of any hierarchical organization (political, economic, or social) aligns with libertarianism.

Tocqueville does not reject the state, unlike Proudhon and other great anarchists like Bakunin or Kropotkin, who venerate the association of "collective forces" that allow individuals to take control of their destinies, to emancipate themselves and pool their strength in a rejection of a state condemned to disappear in favor of self-governance by society.

While Tocqueville may not be libertarian, he raises a crucial point: extreme anti-authoritarianism breeds chaos and destroys freedom by neglecting the diversity of individualism. However, as previously discussed, anarchism **accepts authority when necessary; what this philosophy rejects is power and its coercion**.

### State vs. Government

It is important to clarify that the state is neither the government nor society. While there can be no state without government, governance can occur without a state, which imposes itself as a power above society, involving territorial concentration and consolidating many functions of societal life into the hands of a few. This implies new relationships among society's members that did not exist before the formation of the state and are rejected by anarchists, who assert that humans lived in societies for thousands of years before they "accidentally" encountered the state.

In his dialectic of equality and freedom, Tocqueville envisions an "ideal social state" as a means to balance these values. However, in the absence of this utopia, democracy is doomed to a "tyranny of the majority" due to a "passion for equality" that leads to retreating into the private sphere, fostering a debilitating trend towards uniformity and social conformity that levels talents and genius downwards at the expense of true freedom (1986, pp. 348-351).

Thus, in his 1835 work *Democracy in America*, he brilliantly anticipates that the way societies organize themselves under a democratic regime would generate publicity, equalization of conditions between men and women, short-termism, mass consumption, etc. Tocqueville **critiques the centralization of power that uniformizes society behind a false principle of equality and reduces the concept of freedom to the pleasures permitted by commerce, turning enjoyment into an end in itself and making men slaves to their desires.**
