In this subsidiary approach to distributing the power to act, “hierarchical authority plays the role of *subsidium*, activated when necessary to provide support, reinforcement, or assistance” (Detchessahar, 2019, p. 88).

However, what the libertarian praxis of Web 3.0 challenges is the static nature of hierarchy, which, even when intended to be subsidiary, still preserves figures of authority.

This critique draws from Locke’s philosophy, questioning why individuals, free in the state of nature, would abdicate their liberty in favor of an authority.

According to Locke, the main purpose of individuals “when they unite in community and submit to a government is to preserve their properties” (Locke, 1992, p. 157).

When addressing the right to resist oppression, Locke proposes five causes that justify the dissolution of power when it no longer serves the function for which it was established.

Firstly, when the legislative power is altered because those holding power express personal arbitrary will rather than enforcing the laws that govern the community. Then, if the current power prevents the legislative, renormalizing power from assembling. Next, when power is transferred from one actor to another without the collective’s consent. Furthermore, when authority is subjected or delivered to another decision-making power. Finally, when power is neglected or abandoned, thus failing in its duties.

For each scenario, Locke asserts that the right to resist oppression is legitimate and necessary to prevent these unacceptable situations from devolving into tyranny. Locke’s theory of tyrannicide is a revolutionary theory, framing the right to resist oppression as an organic principle of constitutional law.

The libertarian praxis of Web 3.0 seeks to resolve the problem of power’s corruptibility through decentralization.
