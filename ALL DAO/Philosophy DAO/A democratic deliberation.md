This brief overview of the possibilities offered to companies by the Aragon project allows organizations to envision a decentralized future thanks to the programmable nature of power distribution within a DAO.

Thus, while it is possible to fall into an authoritarian drift by configuring the organization in a way that leaves no room for employees, who may then suffer under a dehumanizing system that treats them merely as roles, as seen in Robertson's holacracy system, it is equally possible to set up the organization in a holistic and holocratic manner, ensuring that no voice within the organization is neglected and allowing each individual's uniqueness to express and exchange freely.

The tool itself is amoral.

It is up to the individuals manipulating the Aragon application to choose whether the organization should be built on selfish libertarian foundations or on an altruistic libertarian praxis.

Organizational anarchy finds its true meaning through this tool, which allows a collective within a company to deliberate in a fully democratic manner on the modalities of the organization to be established for creating the appropriate DAO for a given activity.

Once again, only the limits of human imagination constrain the possibilities that such a system of autonomous decentralized organization can open up.

For example, it is entirely possible to conceive of an organization where leadership shifts from one person to another depending on the variables the company faces.

According to the situation, authority could be transferred from one agent to another by a vote of the collective, which would recognize the ideal person at a specific moment. To quote Hannah Arendt: "Those whose obedience is required recognize it unconditionally; there is no need for coercion or persuasion in this case" (2012, p. 943).

Authority would then emerge naturally to fulfill its task in the etymological sense of the term, augere, to increase the collective and guide it in the best direction.

It is also possible to assign more or less weighty votes depending on the subjects.

For example, a person from the marketing department might have a simple vote on decisions regarding the production chain but a double or triple vote on decisions concerning the commercial aspect.

Conversely, workers closest to the actual tasks required would have a voting power three to four times greater to renormalize processes at their posts on the production line.

Furthermore, the ability to provide feedback on colleagues' votes can influence and lead agents to reconsider their votes with a more informed perspective thanks to the opinions of their peers.

This can occur both through the application and during informal discussions by the coffee machine, because if the goal is to facilitate exchanges and collective decisions, the company must remain human above all.
