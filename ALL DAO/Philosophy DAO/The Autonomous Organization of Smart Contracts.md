Given Ethereum's success and the vast number of smart contract (SC) applications developed on its network, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) has created a private version of the public ETH network to build applications with smart contracts designed to perform better. These contracts enable automated, incorruptible, and regulated processes, such as identity verification or supply chain management, by embedding various legal states or standards into the SC.

Smart contracts continue to enrich the blockchain ecosystem daily, advancing its technical and functional capabilities as it expands into industrial and commercial territories.

Thanks to what’s known as an oracle—a system that provides external, real-world data to the blockchain, enabling smart contracts to fulfill their terms and execute—processes like birth registrations, property transfers, and more can be automated. This removes the need for intermediaries in fields like notary services, insurance (for instance, Axa has already implemented automated refunds for delayed flights), real estate, logistics, finance, and even management.

Well-designed and coded smart contracts can drastically reduce the number of intermediaries and, importantly, transaction costs. A program could effectively guide a worker better than a manager in some cases. Managing is a psychologically challenging task for people, as it involves the complexity of one-on-one interactions. With the diversity of profiles between managers and those being managed, leading a work group with a potentially disputed authority isn’t always straightforward. The advantage with a program is that it’s indisputable. When everyone knows the rules of a smart contract, including any potential reward or penalty mechanisms, they naturally become self-managed, encouraged to self-discipline by the SC.

However, it’s essential that program development is consensual among company members, or even tailored individually, rather than solely driven by the business leader, as this could lead to a techno-authoritarian drift. Smart contracts can undoubtedly be either a tool for harsh control or a means to liberate from coercion. The nuanced role of a manager often involves balancing this constraint and coercion that the position demands. This is why SCs could represent an alternative. Kaleido, for instance, offers management solutions via SCs to companies, and Aragon custom-builds decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) systems for its professional clients, which we will explore further in part 3.

Collective deliberation on the fine-tuned parameters of a desired algorithmic governance model for a given type of organization is crucial. Since blockchain technologies fundamentally aim at greater decentralization, these choices must find the right consensus mechanisms suited to organizing specific work and securing systemic adherence. The cohesion of a work group is essential for organizational efficiency, and a good consensus mechanism should incentivize agents within a collective so that each person’s interests align.

Each blockchain has its own consensus mechanism, each with its strengths and weaknesses. We’ll explore different types of consensus mechanisms offered by decentralized protocols following Bitcoin and Ethereum. Given the wide range of consensus models, this list will be non-exhaustive, focusing on well-proven decentralized mechanisms.
