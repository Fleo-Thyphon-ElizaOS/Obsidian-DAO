To summarize in one sentence, libertarian praxis is a dynamic self-improving social model that recursively empowers its members, who enjoy equal decision-making power and respect the practical imperative of [[Immanuel Kant]]. To recall, this Kantian imperative states: **“Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means”** (Kant, 1994, p. 108).

# Resilience of Collective Organization

Furthermore, this social dynamic is more than resilient; it is antifragile. This means it strengthens the collective when exposed to stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, errors, faults, attacks, or failures, allowing individuals to improve in an unstable environment (Taleb, 2013).

This characteristic is attributable to the system's great capacity to leverage **the diversity that constitutes it**. Within a libertarian praxis, the inevitable conflicts between divergent viewpoints are, far from being sterile, constructive as they are accepted and considered.

Indeed, in an organization where the diversity of opinions is a wealth, how could one ignore them? The inclusion of each voice is what nurtures the collective.

Mary Parker Follett, a pioneer in organizational theory, encourages us to view conflict as **“not the unfortunate manifestation of incompatibilities, but as a normal process through which socially useful differences declare themselves, enriching all those involved”** (1924, p. 300).

Thus, social anarchism aims to establish order without power. Valuing creative interaction, this philosophy promotes **“relationship and cooperation”** and allows for opposition without violence, while caring for others and Nature (Caillé & al., _Manifeste convivialiste. Déclaration d'interdépendance_, 2013, p. 14).

For anarchism to gain traction, one must first think “out of the box,” beyond what Bourdieu calls **“the amnesia of genesis”** to denounce the unscientific and ideological nature of neoliberal doctrine, which he formulates as follows: **“one of the effects of the symbolic power associated with the institution of the State is precisely the naturalization, in the form of doxa, of more or less arbitrary presuppositions that were at the very origin of the State”** (Bourdieu, 2012, p. 185).

Libertarian praxis reminds the collective that it can create, dismantle, and recreate itself in total autonomy.

Renormalization takes on a whole new dimension in this sense.

It goes without saying that such a conception of organization calls for a quantum leap in the organizational philosophy within which humanity develops.

Despite the proposals made by new forms of organizational structures in companies, it is difficult to find in what has already been experienced an analogous organization.

Indeed, the questioning of private property is hardly ever addressed; organizational anarchy and the libertarian organization of work proposed by the tools of the internet of value serve as a UFO in this field. Nevertheless, the trend found in the path opened by blockchains seems to lead collectives toward greater accountability and autonomy.
