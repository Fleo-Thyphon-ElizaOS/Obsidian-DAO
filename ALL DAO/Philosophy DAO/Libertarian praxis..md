Thus, we are far removed from the nihilists, terrorists, and other marginalized individuals without causes to whom anarchists can be assimilated in the collective unconscious.

In truth, anarchists are the antithesis of nihilism, in the Nietzschean sense [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], as they place much greater importance on morality, truth, and the affirmation of their singular existence, an expression of their idiosyncrasy aimed at achieving individuation as a unique being.

Social anarchism is a practical philosophy, rooted in daily practice by its very nature.

Both **evolutionary and revolutionary, altruistic and emancipatory**, libertarianism, with its dynamic vision and serial dialectic that articulates a utopian vision of society with the practical problems of everyday life, stands as an alternative philosophy to neoliberal ideology and its wild capitalism, which has a fixed view of life, offering to revolutionize a world that will be libertarian or will simply cease to exist.

This libertarian praxis represents a genuine paradigmatic shift to provide positive responses to the concrete and timely needs generated by a system that has outstripped itself.

In Marxist philosophy, praxis refers to **“the set of practices through which man transforms nature and the world, engaging him in the social structure determined by the relations of production at a given stage of history.”**

Praxis involves a dimension of aim and result, but also of meaning and subjectivity.

**Anarchist praxis thus takes on full meaning in an evolutionary aim for human ends, standing in stark contrast to the laws of the market.**.
