A DAO can quickly disrupt power dynamics depending on the consensus chosen within a protocol. For example, the Dash protocol we just studied operates on a relatively plutocratic governance model, as the 1,000 Dash required to be a voting masternode costs around €80,000 as of the end of February 2022.

Generally, to join a DAO, one must purchase its native token, which grants governance rights to participate in the organization’s decisions and propose ideas. The weight of a vote in the decision-making process often depends on the number of tokens held, although this is not always systematic and may vary based on the DAO's financial performance. The token's price can increase, potentially enriching its owners.

# Consensus Mechanism
What is truly revolutionary about this way of thinking about the economy is the inversion it implies in the philosophy of work. A token serves as an incentive because it creates value, even though it does not inherently possess value at the time of its creation. However, the exchange of services and goods conducted on the network where a token is distributed gives it value, transforming it into a crypto asset or even a local cryptocurrency depending on its use. For a genuine paradigmatic shift to occur among worker collectives, especially those in the physical world who have taxing tasks, work must be organized around an egalitarian consensus among the entire collective with equitable voting rights. Thus, a consensus mechanism must be found that is neither plutocratic, nor nepotistic, nor oligarchic, nor dictatorial, nor totalitarian, but rather a holocratic system: governed by all. This distributed power allows for the inclusion of all stakeholders.

As discussed in section 1.4.2 with the different consensus mechanisms, pure proof of stake (PPoS) and secure proof of stake (SpoS) can address the power capture caused by excessive token holdings (which grant more voting power within a DAO) by allowing network nodes to become validators randomly or semi-randomly. However, other more equitable and just consensus mechanisms can be imagined, and there are already companies offering tailor-made DAO models to other organizations based on their needs. In doing so, companies operating in the "real world," far from fintechs, can also benefit from blockchain technologies to optimize the organization of their activities.
