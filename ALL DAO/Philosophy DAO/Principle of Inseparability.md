A social choice function is coherent if it addresses economic, social, ecological, and political issues in an inseparable manner.

What we refer to as the **principle of inseparability** is a process-based approach to the common good, embodied by the collective intention of a human organization to think together (and thus account for and address together) issues related to:

- **Values** (collective propositions of an economic, social, political, ecological nature…),
- **Assets** (economic, ecological, social, cultural resources…),
- **Rights** (economic, ecological, energy, informational capacities…),
- **Currencies** (numerical representations of economic, political, social, ecological relationships…).

Such a criterion could be considered either a principle of inseparability or of integration, as it supplements the principles of aggregation and comparison that are predominant in economic and political evaluation and selection systems.

The principle of inseparability is valuable as it pertains to integration, recognized in many scientific models as an essential marker of a group's level of consciousness. For instance, see the “Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness” (IIT) model by Giulio Tononi (2004).

*Integrated, holistic wealth can be defined by several criteria: exchangeable, measurable, rankable, accountable, and expressible by all users.*

A process-based approach to these four objects (value, asset, right, and currency) for the first time enables establishing internal links (intra-actions), which are more powerful than the external links (interactions) observed when these objects are perceived separately and in isolation (as factors).

This approach allows establishing a principle of procedural equality that derives its effectiveness not only from arbitrating among different assets, values, rights, and currencies (the classic definition of a resource allocation system) but from the ability to transform each of these objects into one another, reversibly, treating them as equivalent functions in the manner of a mathematical set with four elements.

The core subject in creating integrated, holistic wealth will therefore be learning to transform values into currencies, currencies into values, values into assets, assets into values, assets into currencies, currencies into assets, currencies into quantified rights, quantified rights into currencies, values into rights, rights into values.

Holistic, integrated wealth could be defined according to several criteria: exchangeable, measurable, rankable, accountable, and expressible by all users.

In our decision-making approach to economic phenomena, we assert that a value cannot be monetized if it has not first been transformed into an asset with an accounting representation, allowing it to enter the economic sphere.

Similarly, we argue that an asset **cannot be equitably distributed unless it constitutes rights quantitatively defined in monetary form.**

In the same way, we claim that a currency cannot guarantee its acceptability among all users if it is not based on values chosen, accounted for, measured, and expressed by all users.

Whether in resource allocation, currency issuance, social choice, or optimization, people should have decision-making procedures that allow them to collectively select their values, assets, rights, and currencies.

A decision-making procedure is symbolically effective if it enables people to vote *with* values, assets, rights, and currencies, rather than merely *on* values, assets, rights, and currencies.

In legal terms, the weakness and indeterminacy of decision-making procedures are tied to the inability to make choices using values, assets, rights, and currencies (not just about them).

An economy in which products satisfy 100% of the entire production, distribution, consumption, and recycling chain is not a utility-driven supply economy but an equitable demand-driven economy.

**An economy in which products embody all the values that users collectively wish to promote is an equitable, participative economy rather than a utilitarian, competitive one.**

An economy focused solely on improving existing values and standards is a quantitative, utilitarian economy.

An economy that opens to innovation and proposes new values or standards—potentially rendering existing values or standards obsolete—is an economy of equity.

Currently, two main families of collective decision-making procedures exist: Condorcet-type procedures, which are “goal-oriented,” based on pure ordinal ranking and referred to as “compare and aggregate,” and Arrow-type procedures, which are “process-oriented,” based on cardinal treatment and referred to as “aggregate and compare.”

However, a third approach, known as **welfare economics**, could be added, which combines the characteristics of the first two by questioning the choice of decision rule based on the type of society one wishes to create. This third approach, we believe, uniquely integrates questions of values, assets, rights, and currency into a complex and dynamic computational approach without reducing these issues to purely quantitative choices, which ultimately prevent the full expression of social choice.
