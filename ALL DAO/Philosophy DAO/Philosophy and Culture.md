## **Philosophy and Culture**

DAOs represent a new framework for large-scale human coordination, and at the heart of human coordination—whether decentralized or not—lies organizational culture.

Not different from the company culture of an early startup or the community culture in an unknown music scene, **culture can be defined as the behaviors, patterns, and values** that emerge among groups of individuals. In their foundational essay, **"[Squad Wealth](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/)"**, the research organization Other Internet notes that culture can encompass everything from "memes, hot takes, internal language, 𝓪𝓮𝓼𝓽𝓱𝓮𝓽𝓲𝓬𝓼, to artifacts that can only be articulated as a group."

While each DAO finds its own means to foster a culture with visual, linguistic, and behavioral norms, two traits seem particularly common in the DAO landscape: the tendency for voters to act as owners and the expectation of radical transparency.
