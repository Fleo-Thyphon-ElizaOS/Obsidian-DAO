There is a real paradox in the fact that what underpins the people's right to control their own currency is **not found in our monetary instruments**.

When seeking to establish correlations between currency and human rights, the first major direction is to reflect in terms of the monetary organization of social and economic life.

This is a completely classic attitude, as Ricardo conceived political economy as a science of organization. However, to take as the object of monetary economics a form of organization of economic activities and social relations breaks with the habit of considering this object as money itself.

In contact with history, one quickly realizes that the monetary phenomenon significantly exceeds money in the precise sense of the term. The issuance of a bill of exchange, in the late Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and during the Modern Era, constituted a monetary act. However, this act did not exclusively operate on money, as the debts between merchants it aimed to create, extinguish, or modify had neither the liquidity, nor the versatility, nor the broad acceptability that characterizes money in the strictest sense. It is undeniable that we have here a form of monetary organization, which shows that there can be a monetary phenomenon without the intervention of money.

Instruments even further removed from money, such as the mandatory letter of the 12th and 13th centuries, were used to make payments.

It is therefore important not to define monetary acts based on money: an operation can be deemed monetary even if it does not involve money.

We are even led to take a diametrically opposed stance: by defining money based on monetary acts, we call "currencies" the assets on which monetary acts operate most easily, the assets whose primary vocation is to serve the execution of monetary acts.

The ease of use, versatility, and extension of the diffusion area thus constitute the main criteria for defining degrees of monetary qualification.

The term "money" applies to assets that have a very high degree of monetary qualification.

Therefore, it is a reifying conception to believe that agents transmit bank money when they make a transaction, as in reality they are merely carrying out monetary acts that have the effect of **modifying the state of their claims and debts, an accounting state we call a quantified relationship with a creditor pole and a debtor pole**.

It is essential to understand that it is not money as a thing that externally triggers the emergence or disappearance of claims; it is the creation or destruction of claims that has a monetary dimension, constituting a step in a monetary creation process, and which ultimately fulfills a monetary mediation function between agents.

To a significant extent, and provided we accept considering certain categories of financial assets (those for which the rules of creation and destruction are the most flexible) as monetary, we find that it is indeed the monetary acts that, by modifying the quantified relationships between agents, lead to the creation or destruction of financial assets.

As the historian specializing in the medieval era, Marc Bloch, wrote, "From the fact that an act stipulates a price or a fee in money, one cannot legitimately deduce, in the absence of more precise information, that the payment actually took place in fiat money." And we would add: or in the form of bookkeeping operations.

Consequently, it is not to money that one should refer when seeking an operational vision of economic exchanges, but solely to monetary acts.

**The "monetary" act that is at the origin of all exchanges of goods or services and of any modification of the state of claims and debts is called payment.**

A monetary act can be defined as a human payment function that allows for the modification of quantified relationships among the members of a community.

By relying on the theory of legal acts and the theory of legal facts, we can see that there exists a large number of monetary acts through which humans have historically executed a payment act without resorting to money.

**Accounting compensation, bills of exchange, account-to-account transfer orders** that modify the state of claims and debts between two agents are excellent examples of this.

Observation of the facts leads us to consider that the payment function originates in humans and not in money.

If the payment function is a human attribute, then it is undoubtedly a universal right.

# Human Payment Function

**The axioms of the Declaration lay the foundational concepts to recognize the human payment function as a natural right and as a fundamental freedom of constitutional value that should be imposed on states and banks.**

By linking the payment function with the theory of monetary acts, the goal of this declaration is to provide the foundations for a universal monetary theory.

Only the universal dimension will make money appropriable and inscribable by all those who wish to produce, distribute, and exchange it for uses they choose.

Placed in this perspective of individual and collective decision-making, money is no longer just the representative of **production and economic exchange relations**, but it is also the representative of **expression and social representation relations** that it signifies.

Paying does not only mean

- extinguishing a debt, but also
- pacifying,
- reconciling,
- readjusting,
- rebalancing,
- exchanging,
- buying,
- selling,
- repairing, which are all relational acts of fundamental importance for our social, economic, and political life.

This extension of classical monetary approaches will reposition monetary practices within the field of social value production by linking them to the functioning of democracy and issues related to the allocation of resources within human communities where everyone should be able to be heard.

**Universal monetary law posits the principle of a democratic currency.**

It empowers individuals with a new right that can be called the right to payment.

The right to payment can be defined as the ability to enable every individual to execute monetary acts, such as those required to obtain goods and services or to fulfill certain obligations.

It is crucial to understand that being paid means having the capacity to pay in turn. Conversely, paying creates the conditions to be paid in return. Each payment thus necessarily refers to other payments: taken in isolation, a payment has no greater interest than a link detached from its chain.

It is the payment networks that are the phenomenon to which we must pay attention, for what matters most is to know what connects monetary acts to other monetary acts and to real acts.

This approach, attentive to the entirety of payments, the structure of the whole, and the conditions of their realization, falls within a systemic approach.

In financial terms, this is called the monetary system; in legal terms, it is a systemic right recognized for all: the right to carry out monetary acts under the best conditions, for the benefit of each individual and all the individuals who make up the payment community.

It is on the basis of the right to payment and the theory of monetary acts that one could legally formulate the claims of the Relative Theory of Money:

- the freedom to choose the monetary system (money does not impose itself);
- the freedom to use resources (economic and monetary);
- the freedom to assess and produce any value (a principle of economic relativity);
- the freedom to exchange in the currency of one's choice (display, account in the chosen monetary unit).

All these freedoms, upon closer examination, pertain to the absolute freedom recognized to each human being to carry out monetary acts that respond to their interest.

It is in the perspective of the right to payment that it is appropriate to read and interpret all the axioms proposed in this Universal Declaration of Monetary Rights.

The theory of monetary acts lays the foundations for a sovereign, universal, utilitarian, and equitable monetary system.

An open system imbued with meaning as long as it is based on the human element.

It endows society with an intrinsic balance that is never acquired and is in perpetual renewal.

Democratic currency is a

- sovereign,
- intelligent,
- dynamic and programmatic endogenous currency where the individual is the source of growth and stability.

Thus, we can posit that a democratic monetary system is a coordinating mechanism that guarantees everyone the full exercise of their right to payment.

The payment function is a communication act that uses money as a means, that is, **as a medium and not as a metal**, meaning **as a weapon**.

It is because money will start to be apprehended as a signifier and not merely as a signified that it will become open to the entirety of human expressions.

Through such a monetary approach, many issues can be addressed:

- precariousness,
- rural exodus,
- growth,
- blind capitalism,
- currency wars,
- political renewal,
- social innovation,
- sustainable development.

_To pay etymologically means to pacify._

Understanding what the human payment function means and working toward its real recognition to affirm its universal status could represent a significant step toward establishing peace in the world and toward a union **of peoples based on cooperation and respect**.
