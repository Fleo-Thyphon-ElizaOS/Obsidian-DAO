# Algorithmic Governance

It is evident that algorithmic governance models offered by blockchains tend toward an "organizational anarchy, a break from hierarchical organization, which opens a path toward a pluralistic, flexible, and adaptable mode of organization" (Chevallier, 1997, p. 267).

This trend aligns with the postmodern thinking in organizational and managerial fields, which emerged in the second half of the 20th century, highlighting the limitations of the classical concept of a rational organization governed by formal order.

# Organized Anarchy and Ehrard Friedberg

Ehrard Friedberg, emeritus professor of sociology at Sciences Po, explains that organized anarchy "usefully reminds us to be wary of the appearances of rationality, instrumentality, and goal-oriented actions that organizations often present. Just as challenging the premise of clear and exogenous preferences in the rational model leads to a reassessment of human action’s intentionality and emphasizes its structuring and driving by situational opportunities, the abandonment of an overly instrumental and cohesive view of the organization prompts questions about the goal-orientation of its actions and the control of events by its actors. This notion should be understood as a topic, a way to sharpen our understanding of the appearances of rationality and purposefulness of actions within organizations" (1997, p.15).

This confirms the transition from a mechanical organizational paradigm to an organic form that is more agile and adaptable to environmental variations.

# Internal Chaos

According to Thiétart and Forgues, the organization is "a nonlinear dynamic system whose forces can only lead to internal chaos" (2006, p. 48), a model described in organized anarchy theory (Cohen & March, 1972). "However, this chaos has organizing properties" (2006, p. 48).

Thiétart and Forgues thus affirm that the most diverse rationalities emerge, allowing each individual to operate within an organization with their interests in mind and to "create rational and certainty zones within which they can decide and manage" autonomously (2006, p. 48).

Just as a natural order emerges from chaos (derived from the principle of entropy), so too does a natural organic order arise from the internal chaos inherent to organizations (inherently dynamic).

Beaujolin-Bellet and Schmidt describe the organization (citing Gollac and Volkoff, 2007) as comprising "a panorama of forms of degradation/restructuring of working conditions" (2012, p. 46).

This echoes the principle of renormalization, during which new norms and values challenge those that are pre-established. Ergology refers to this as the "renormalization of preceding norms" (Schwartz & Durrive, 2009, p. 259).
