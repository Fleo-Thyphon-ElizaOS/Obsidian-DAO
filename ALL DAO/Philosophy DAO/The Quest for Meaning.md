To illustrate this universal need to construct one’s own meaning, Boris Cyrulnik states that “the meaning of things is not in **objective reality, but in the story and the purpose pursued**” (2004, p. 36). He adds the need for pleasure to this human search for meaning, claiming that "when pleasure couples with meaning, life is worth breaking stones for" (2004, p. 37).

# Social Relations of Humans
From this perspective, the body-self represents the archetype of a free individual, creator of their own values, which are defined arbitrarily and in interdependence with others. Even in isolation, a person is never truly alone and always depends on a human network.

However, neoliberal heteronomy, through the increasing atomization of society and the extreme individualization it promotes, seems to make people forget how **connected and interdependent they are**. The standardized mass production of civilization, molded in the worship of competition, which Lévi-Strauss laments in comparison to beet monoculture (1955), is precisely what Hannah Arendt describes as the “totalitarian system” of the market.

# Isolation
“Social atomization and extreme individualization preceded mass movements, which attracted completely unorganized people—stubborn individualists who had always refused to recognize social ties and obligations—much more easily and quickly than sociable, non-individualistic members of traditional parties. In fact, the masses developed from the fragments of a highly atomized society, where the competitive structure and resulting individual loneliness were limited only by class belonging. The main characteristic of the mass man is not brutality or backwardness, **but isolation and the lack of normal social relationships**” (Arendt, 2005, p. 39). This says much about the alienating nature of social isolation.

Thus, the prescriptive model of any organization operating under a commercial system tends to direct the use of self by others (the company, the market-driven society, etc.) toward this social atomism, initiating a process that challenges self-use by self.

Indeed, the body-self is then caught in tension between the use that the active person wishes to make of themselves and the use expected by others. It becomes a matter of a normative and value-based debate that creates a genuine internal conflict—a tearing of the body-self confronted with a situation that requires arbitration between the goals set by institutional norms and the antecedent norms that the body-selves self-prescribe upon taking up their roles to infuse **the singular meaning they need to instill into their activity.**
