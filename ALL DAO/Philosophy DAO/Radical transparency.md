Transparency plays a crucial role in any organizational culture as it establishes trust among all stakeholders. DAOs enable this at an unprecedented level due to the public and immutable activity of any DAO's ETH address on the blockchain. This creates both an implicit and explicit system of checks and balances that allows a community of stakeholders to stay informed about how a DAO utilizes its capital while ensuring that a management team makes decisions aligned with the community.

Such radical transparency encourages collaboration rather than competition and enables individuals to take ownership of their work due to their deep understanding of the organizational context.

Ultimately, the culture of a DAO is defined by the individual relationships formed among groups of individuals, which can be distilled into a reproducible set of behaviors and patterns.

Through new forms of fractional ownership and transparency, DAOs have the potential to create new organizational structures where users are no longer passive participants on a platform but are active, properly incentivized owners of a networkâ€”with trust and coordination at the center. This distribution of power and culture leads to greater agility, resilience, and antifragility that could help create a world in which large groups of people on the Internet can confront even the most powerful centralized companies.
