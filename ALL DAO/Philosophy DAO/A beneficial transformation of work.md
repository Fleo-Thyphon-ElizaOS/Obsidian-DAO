For the poet Khalil Gibran, "work is love made visible," allowing one to "stay attuned to the earth and the soul of the earth" (1929). This brings us back to Morin's notion of reliance, for whom "at the highest level of complexity, reliance can only be love" (Morin, 2004, p. 40). In other words, what constitutes society are the common projects from which love, rendered visible through collective work, emerges. The real question behind this common work is: what do we desire to strive for? If the only motivation is money, then the heteronomy of monetary power continues to alienate the collective in the market illusion of neoliberalism. In this pro-metanoia state, man remains like a caterpillar in its chrysalis, suffocated by the gigantic financial coffin structure he has created.

On the other hand, if the collective's will is to strive for continuous and dynamic self-improvement of human creative potential, rather than feeding its capacity for destruction, then the inter-autonomy of a renormalizing libertarian praxis is the only developmental path leading to metanoia—from caterpillar to butterfly—emancipating it from heteronomy. The individualism promoted by the neoliberal model does not seem to steer towards collective metanoia due to the social atomization it engenders, dividing a group that needs unity. To quote Bakunin again: "work is the only fundamental basis of dignity and human rights." This is why work must also be treated as a common good.

Viewing work from such a level of disaffection helps us understand the importance of collective structures as a normalizing and renormalizing framework designed by a network of intersubjectivities. What creates heteronomy within a structure is indeed the absence of participation from those who will work within a framework dictated by others, the absence of reliance and inter-autonomy. However, the decentralized governance now available to companies through the internet of value allows for the inclusion of every stakeholder in the collective's nomos, restoring genuine active participation for all.

The collective dimension of work in creating company norms is fundamental for tasks performed within the subjective dimension to occur under optimal conditions. When aligned with work mobilizing invested knowledge, it becomes easier for individuals to conform to the established work norms they have participated in shaping and co-creating. Decentralized governance thus opens a dialogue between aligned and misaligned knowledge, creating a virtuous organizational dynamic that self-reinforces through collective intelligence, integrating the plurality of singularities.

Blockchains, along with the organizational transformations they propose through tools that can be deployed on their networks—such as smart contracts, cryptography, consensus algorithms, and the establishment of DAOs—open up a whole new field of study for organizational theory. This is particularly true regarding organizational anarchy. Furthermore, the approach favored in this thesis is appreciative.

We will now analyze the libertarian praxis of Web 3.0 through the lens of the ergological paradigm to thoroughly study what these digital tools bring to this approach.
