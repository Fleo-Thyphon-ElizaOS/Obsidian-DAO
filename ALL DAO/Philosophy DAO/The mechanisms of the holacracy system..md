By synthesizing the work of these authors, Robertson created holacracy, envisioning each person within a company as a holon, both a whole and a part, maintaining their own autonomy as a whole—what he calls their "totality"—while also having the capacity to connect with their environment, which is their "partiality," exercising their sovereign power organically.

Thus, as Robertson summarizes, **“instead of structuring a simple power relationship between people – who can give orders to whom – Holacracy structures the work within the system and clarifies the boundaries between the different entities performing this work”** (Robertson, 2016, p. 64).

However, Robertson makes a clear distinction between people on one side and roles on the other.

**“When we distribute authority, [...] it is not to individuals, but to the roles they fulfill. These specific roles are endowed with the necessary authority to perform certain tasks and pursue particular goals”** (p. 55).

This tends to dehumanize work.

This notion of role is defined more precisely in the Holacracy Constitution 5.0 in Article 1.1: **“The Associates of the Organization are generally required to perform work on behalf of the Organization by acting within the framework of an explicitly defined Role. A ‘Role’ is an organizational entity with a descriptive name and one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the ‘Purpose,’ which designates a capacity, potential, or goal that the Role will pursue or manifest on behalf of the Organization; (b) one or more ‘Domains,’ which are things that the Role is the sole authority to control and regulate as its property on behalf of the Organization; (c) one or more ‘Accountabilities,’ which designate activities over the duration of the Organization that the Role will implement.”**

Thus, individuals have significant freedom to organize themselves according to the roles they fulfill, but this comes at the expense of human relationships, which are then replaced, within holacracy, by “role-ations.”

Robertson explains that these **“role-ations”** express **“the relationship between our roles and the contributions that these roles entail from each of us, outside of personal connections”** (2016, p. 59).

Even though workers are autonomous and free to prescribe their own tasks, they remain prisoners of these roles, confining them to “role-ations” and relegating them to the status of automatons. **“It is the worker themselves who defines and ‘energizes’ their roles, in a system that tends toward total transparency with their peers and with the entire organization but remains ‘ultra-normative and controlled’”** (Richard & Christin, 2019, p. 264). This strategy effectively transfers human heteronomy to the heteronomy of the "role."
