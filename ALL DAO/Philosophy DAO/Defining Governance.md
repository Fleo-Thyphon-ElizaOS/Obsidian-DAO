## Preamble
The theme of blockchains and cryptocurrencies fundamentally brings forth the concept of governance. [[Gilles Babinet]], co-chair of the French National Digital Council, leans toward this approach in his book, *Redesigning Public Policy with Digital Technology*, where he explains that “**the fundamental issue of blockchain** lies in its ability to **decentralize consensus** and **trust between unknown actors** within any network of interactions and transactions, two central subjects for the governance of any system” (Babinet, 2020, p. 91).

## Defining Governance
The concept of governance is multifaceted.

From the Latin *gubernare* [[Etymology of the Term "Governance"]], to govern etymologically means “to steer a ship.”

Today, governance can take many forms, hence terms such as **local governance, managerial governance, urban governance, algorithmic governance, territorial governance, European governance, global governance, etc.**

There is no single model of governance but rather a multitude of governance systems.

#### Common Aspect of All Forms: Trust and Buy-In

John Pitseys, PhD in philosophy at the Hoover Chair of Economic and Social Ethics, explored this concept in his research on legal and political philosophy.

He ultimately characterized governance as follows: “Governance thus refers to a technique of social management based on **creating a relationship of trust between the different partners in the political decision-making process. This relationship of trust should facilitate cooperation among actors, simplify their transactions, and make access to others’ knowledge and experiences more available. This enables the production of a norm that is not only more efficient but also more effective, as actors are more likely to agree to it**” (Pitseys, 2010, p. 226).

It is valuable, especially from an ergological perspective, to consider the notion of a “**more efficient norm [...] based on creating a relationship of trust**” at a time when norms and trust are increasingly contested within our “failing democracies” (Simone, 2014).
