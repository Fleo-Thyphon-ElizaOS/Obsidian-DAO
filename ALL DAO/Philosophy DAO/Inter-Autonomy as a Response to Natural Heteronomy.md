The heteronomy imposed by banks, states, or any other intermediary becomes unnecessary when the security provided by these trusted parties can be achieved without human intervention—those capable of abusing power—through incorruptible algorithms instead.

In doing so, it becomes possible to choose a *nomos* (a governing principle or law) that is no longer the "lesser evil" but the best option. By collectively agreeing on the algorithmic program to which they wish to adhere, people no longer endure the asymmetrical heteronomy of others; they create an inter-autonomy.

Jacques Derrida reminds us in *Politics of Friendship* that the natural heteronomy that subjects human will to what Emmanuel Levinas calls the “imperialism of the self” (1957) among peers constitutes, in a sense, an original heteronomy. “We are caught, each of us, in a kind of heteronomic and asymmetrical curvature of social space, specifically in our relationship to the other: before any organized society, before any politeia, before any determined ‘government,’ before any ‘law.’ Before and in front of it, in the sense of Kafka’s ‘before the law.’

Let us be clear: before any specific law, whether natural or positive, but also before law in general. For this heteronomic and asymmetrical curvature of an original sociality law is also a law, perhaps the very essence of law” (Derrida, 1994, p. 258). Thus, pre-existing norms are inevitable, yet we have the means to renormalize.

To overcome this inherent natural heteronomy within the autonomous nature of humanity, *reliance* is the sole path that allows people to be inter-autonomous, to inter-be autonomously.

Just as the combined efforts of humanity have succeeded in bending the universal law of gravity by reaching the moon, human reliance can also bend the universal law of expansionist nature by building an inter-autonomous society.

Autonomy embraced within human interdependence allows for an escape from the limiting framework that Yves Renié calls ADIH, the relationship between autonomy, dependence, independence, and heteronomy (2020). Breaking out of this framework through inter-autonomy is already a metanoia, a new and better norm of conduct that steps beyond limiting intersubjective beliefs and norms, opening up a human collective to a form of libertarian praxis.

For libertarian praxis to be complete, it must lead people away from the desire for individual power, which aligns with centralized governance, and instead toward embracing collective power, typical of decentralized governance.

“If any power could achieve anything, it was indeed the Commune, composed of intelligent, courageous men of incredible honesty who had given indisputable proof of their dedication and energy. Power annihilated them, leaving them only with an implacable will for sacrifice. Power is cursed, and that’s why I am an anarchist” (Michel, 2015).

Thus, libertarian praxis seeks to break this curse of power.
