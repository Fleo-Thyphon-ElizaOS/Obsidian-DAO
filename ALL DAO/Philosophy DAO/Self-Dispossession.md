**Neoliberal Heteronomy and the Paradoxical Demand to Find Happiness in Forced Subjugation by Monetary Power: A Sanctuary of Internal Division Splitting the Self-Body**

By emphasizing the objective aspect of work, the market paradigm alters the collective nature of labor, **reducing it to utilitarian collaboration** where the human dimension is mutilated by an ever-increasing demand for productivity, and the subjective dimension is equally battered by the psychological violence of heteronomy that "prevents" work from being "well done."

### Suffering at Work

According to Yves Clot, there is no greater suffering than obstructed work, “this negation of the worker, which **renders them invisible to their counterpart, is one of the greatest forms of violence one can experience**” (2013, pp. 174-175).

Thus, a "dominant enterprise entrusts a manager (subcontractor, distributor, supplier, etc.) with a profitable economic activity, under the condition that certain rules and controls defined by the enterprise are followed” (Supiot, 2015, p. 319).

Monetary power, coupled with contractual power, enables **employers to bend employees to their will**, effectively controlling the *nomos*.

### Definition of "Employee"

If we consider the etymology of the verb *to employ* (from Latin *in-plicare*), it means “to fold into,” or one who “can bend to another’s will in executing their work” (p. 336). Is it the fate of employees to be bent to the will of their employers?

A self-body so bent, subjugated to another's will, condemned to a heteronomy devoid of meaning, where the possibility of renormalizing (creating meaning) is constrained, becomes a disowned self-body.

### People Are Lazy

The disowned self-body represents an individual deprived of the creative ownership that leaves them with “**no choice but between voluntary servitude or futile rebellion**” (Buber, 2012, p. 91). This view of work as a system of constraints resonates with McGregor’s Theory X, where individuals are considered inherently lazy, requiring strict control to work. This demotivates them and leads to a sense of irresponsibility, causing active disengagement that confirms the initial assumption and creates a toxic atmosphere within the organization.

### Blockchain Solution

To reclaim this self-body alienated by heteronomy within a work environment that excludes individuals from participating in norm creation, the consensus mechanisms provided by blockchain can shift an organization from McGregor’s Theory X to Theory Y, in which **people enjoy working and need autonomy and responsibility**. This fosters a sense of trust, generating motivation that validates Theory Y in a virtuous cycle.

In a trustless blockchain system, there is no need to “build trust” — trust is intrinsic and inherently present between parties. When there’s no need to “gain” trust, this promotes self-responsibility.

This enables a collective, rather than hierarchical, meaning-making, viewing work not as a constraint system but as a “constellation of challenges” (Clot, 2008, p. 150) faced in interdependent collaboration.

A challenge may be destructive and “develop as a recurring obstacle” (Clot, 2008, p. 98). Yet, it can equally be a source of creativity and growth for the collective. For [[Yves Schwartz]], without the ability to overcome this “obstructed activity,” both individually and collectively, “we risk losing our place in this complex world of debates, which is, after all, the world of our life” (2009, p. 81). The self-body is inherently alive and dynamic, continually negotiating norms and values within itself. **To obstruct this salutogenic process, which promotes health and well-being, is to fall into the pathogenic**.

In *The Normal and the Pathological*, [[Georges Canguilhem]] explains that “what characterizes health is the ability to exceed the norm that defines temporary normality, to tolerate deviations from the usual norm, and to create new norms in new situations” (2013, pp. 170-171). Yves Schwartz, drawing on this Canguilhemian perspective, argues that “it is no longer possible to live healthily” if renormalization is no longer an option. Simone Weil adds, “**nothing paralyzes thought more than the sense of inferiority imposed by the daily indignities of poverty, subordination, and dependency. The first step for them is to help them regain or maintain, as the case may be, a sense of dignity**” (2002, p. 153).
