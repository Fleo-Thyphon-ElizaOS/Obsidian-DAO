Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), to be efficient, draw their creativity from the essence of collective intelligence. By achieving an egalitarian consensus that can fully decentralize an organization’s governance, human collectives grant themselves the right to act together, no longer in opposition to one another—except in constructive opposition. Indeed, systemic thinking and action incorporate all opposing views and create a crucial synthesis so that decision-making truly reflects the will of the working collective. As seen in section 2.3.4 with Mary Parker Follett, conflict is normal and enriches all involved (1924, p. 300); it is essential for advancing both individuals and the collective through interactions that deepen stakeholder engagement.

“Simply ‘sharing’ an idea is not enough for it to become the group’s idea; it must be developed and produced collectively. This is Follett’s key mechanism of integration: constructive conflict” (Mousli, 2000, p. 29). One pitfall of management is the role managers play as intermediaries between various company actors under their charge. By arbitrating, managerial conflict management prevents a natural, constructive conflict free of mediation, allowing agents within a collective to enhance relationships and collaboration directly without a third-party intervention. From the Latin *mediare*, mediation means “to be in the middle,” or “to interpose.” If a collective requires such intervention, is the relationship truly authentic?

Of course, humans must sometimes navigate egos that can hinder the humility necessary for conflict to be genuinely constructive. But does this justify delegating the responsibility to resolve conflicts to an intermediary? Is it not preferable to foster collective maturity by allowing the group to experience its own responsibilities, thus making it genuinely moral, as Reclus suggested? A manager disrupts this dynamic by imposing an arbitrary solution, which, through managerial heteronomy, disrupts the inter-autonomy sought by the libertarian praxis of Web 3.0. Intermediaries, to some extent, tend to seize intellectual autonomy.
