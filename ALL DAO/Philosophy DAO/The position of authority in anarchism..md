The verb _augeo_, from which _auctoritas_ (authority) derives, means:

- to bring forth
- to increase
- to produce into existence (Bilheran, 2016, p. 26).

Thus, etymologically, authority is more a service than a constraint.

Therefore, "if authority is a service, it requires the cooperation of others who, at a minimum, voluntarily obey in the etymological sense (ob-audire), meaning they listen to authority.

The servant leader is not necessarily someone who exercises hierarchical power" (Renié, 2020, p. 226).

# Principle of Authority

Anarchism does not question the principle of authority, which is accepted if it is temporary, as evidenced by Lévi-Strauss's work in anthropology that links a certain form of political freedom with the **seasonal variations** of social structures among the Nambikwaras Indians (1948, pp. 1-132), or the structural variations of libertarian societies documented in "Essay on the Seasonal Variations of Eskimo Societies" (Mauss and Beuchat, 1904) or among the Kwakiutls (Boas, 1905), Cheyennes, Crows, Assiniboine, and Lakota (Lowie, 1948), where the establishment **of the authority of an elder** over the community is reported during a season to organize the hunt before **this authority disappears** the following season.

# Assembling Around Common Laws

According to Mathieu Detchessahar, "We voluntarily choose to listen to authority (ob-audire) because it increases (augmenter – augere – is the Latin root of authority) the community by allowing it both to act (to decide) and to take into account **the plurality** of the people who compose it while maintaining its cohesion (where the mere exercise of power always threatens the community with explosion and a return to violence)" (2019, pp. 86-87).

Thus, organizational anarchy is a voluntarist organization in which men **equal in decision-making power can choose to spontaneously and temporarily obey a person or group that can exercise authority (to increase the community) in a specific situation**.

For Hannah Arendt, "those whose obedience is required recognize it unconditionally; in this case, there is no need for coercion or persuasion" (2012, p. 943).

In the context of the tools of the internet of value, one can say that the implementation of a **co-constructed** algorithm by a collective corresponds to the voluntary creation of authority aimed at increasing the community.

# Blockchain Algorithm

Thus, by configuring a blockchain to achieve a specific objective, individuals agree to obey the authority of an algorithm and its rules unconditionally, without coercion, since the rules of the game accepted by the algorithm have been co-created and accepted beforehand.

For this to work, it is essential that the algorithm be regarded as a **common good, based more on libertarian principles and a concern for common ownership than for private ownership**, and again, a paradigm shift is inevitable to use these tools in this way.
