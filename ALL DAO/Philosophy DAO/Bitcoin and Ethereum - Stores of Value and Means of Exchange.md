### The Value of Bitcoin Compared to the Dollar (and Other Fiat Currencies):

The additional value that blockchain brings compared to existing technologies and the systems it aims to evolve or replace is truly revolutionary. To illustrate this, let’s do a little economic exercise. Bitcoin is not only a blockchain protocol but also a cryptocurrency whose supporters hope it will supplant current currencies, called fiat, or even gold as a store of value.

Now that you understand the intrinsic value of a Bitcoin, let’s compare it with its most direct competitor, paper money.

So, what do you think? Do you find that the 10-euro bill in your pocket has an intrinsic value beyond that of a colored piece of paper? If yes, then consider what would happen to the intrinsic value of that bill if the issuing authority decided it was no longer valid, as with the transition from francs to euros. Or, if they decided to print it indefinitely...

Do you see that its assigned value (exchange value) is based only on a belief or a promise by authorities?

This promise of value comes from monetary authorities, which are not independent of political power or certain private interests. It is, in fact, merely a reflection of the power of states and economies. As a citizen and consumer, you have absolutely no impact or control over these factors. The legitimacy debate of Cryptocurrency vs. Fiat Currency cannot be reduced to this single question, and it remains unresolved. However, it is undeniable that, in economic theory, the intrinsic value of a banknote is absolutely zero. Assigning it a discretionary face value is an example of “legal tender” where the state guarantees its economic "power."

Indeed, it’s the state—not market traders, banks, or stock exchanges—that sets the “tempo” of confidence, as it provides the structural foundation.

This power is sometimes purely decreed, with issuing authorities no longer pretending to let market forces take their course.

For example, the parity between the CFA franc and the French franc (now the Euro) is set at 1 euro = 6.55957 francs, not according to supply and demand laws but according to a stability goal, largely as much political as economic.

Similarly, during the current COVID crisis, it is states, along with central banks, deciding to support the economy by printing money and backing markets. I am not making a value judgment here, only stating an observation. Ultimately, these policies and adjustments will impact employment and create economic effects like inflation on a global scale.

Returning to states, they possess genuine power in economic theory terms because basing a currency’s value on the trust the market grants its issuing country is irrational. The nature and determinants of this trust are vague and variable, as they follow no objective criteria and are instead a product of perception, meaning our cognitive biases or, in other words, our subjectivity.

Understanding the importance of this market law exemption is essential. It reverses the value equation, which we could summarize as follows:

- **Theoretical Value Equation**: Intrinsic Value > Use Value > Exchange Value

This aligns with the blockchain model.

- **Reversed Value Equation**: Exchange Value > Use Value > Intrinsic Value

You may need to deconstruct some of your certainties and create a new analysis and decision framework where necessary.

### What Determines Value?

Considering the dual observation of the subjectivity of value and the performative power of code, we could consider that in economics, value represents a scale of appreciation for a good or service assigned by an individual or a group. This sensitive definition of an abstract notion is a first step toward understanding its nature but does not explain its functioning or evolution. To understand it fully, we need to clarify its main determinants, regardless of the economic system or theory in which it is embedded.

If we stick to the previous definition, the most obvious conclusion is that this appreciation scale is determined by the degree of human need satisfaction. However, this is far from always being the case. We can illustrate this with Adam Smith’s famous paradox of water and diamonds, as stated in his seminal work *The Wealth of Nations* (1776): “Nothing is more useful than water, but it can hardly be bought; one can hardly exchange it for anything. A diamond, on the other hand, has almost no use value but can frequently be exchanged for a very great quantity of other goods.”

**Explanation**: Nothing is more vital to human life or more closely satisfies “primary” human needs than water, yet its exchange value has never been particularly high, simply because it is an abundant resource. Diamonds, by contrast, do not reach water’s use value but possess an extremely high exchange value simply due to their rarity.

Thus, scarcity, more than utility, would be the primary source of value in economics. Understanding this means letting go of a rational economic world and accepting the reality of an "irrational" economic world, shedding light on one of the primary reasons for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasm.

To clarify, here are a few details on the nature of scarcity:

- **Scarcity** is one of Bitcoin’s most fundamental properties: 21 million units will be created worldwide, no more, no less.
  
- **Who ensures this scarcity?** Code. 21 million Bitcoins and not one more. This limitation theoretically holds *ad vitam aeternam*. Practically, it will last as long as the majority of users agree on this numerical restriction’s validity.

- **Can we be sure?** Consensus is a governance method that maintains blockchain integrity and decentralization or distribution. For Bitcoin, this involves the Proof of Work (POW) consensus method. We will cover this in detail in the section on blockchain aspects and technical specifications.

- **Why this scarcity?** It is artificial rather than natural scarcity, similar to diamonds. However, both operate under the same rules and logic: a scarce Bitcoin will appreciate more in the market with constant demand than an abundant Bitcoin.
