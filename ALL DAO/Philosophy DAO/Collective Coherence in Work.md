**Another key advantage of a DAO lies in its capacity to establish an empowering environment for collective renormalization by distributing power equally and/or justly within an organization.**

All human work is built on preexisting norms—norms established by previous workers that set the essential framework for effective functioning. As [[Yves Schwartz]] points out, “preexisting norms define the conditions of human action through two characteristics: priority and anonymity” (2009, p. 258). This fundamental heteronomy is crucial for enabling work.

However, since every task must be performed here and now by a unique individual, Schwartz explains that “**activity is a constantly renewed attempt by a unique individual to replay in the present a configuration of norms that are both prior to action and anonymous. Through this confrontation to a certain degree, preexisting norms make human activity possible**” (p. 258).

For philosopher Bernard Stiegler, “‘autonomy’ always comes from [...] a primary heteronomy, which makes autonomy always relative: this relative autonomy is a relational autonomy (dialogic) that composes with heteronomy; it plays creatively with transitional space. It invents norms in the enormity of pathogenesis” (Stiegler, 2010. p. 428).

While preexisting norms may initially seem restrictive, they aid workers by granting access to accumulated skills and the empirical experience of their profession. 

**Norms as a Support for Tasks**

Composing with heteronomy, both individually and collectively, is part of life. Yves Schwartz emphasizes that each person is “subject to internal debates, ‘norm debates,’ sometimes visible to others and to us, sometimes not. [...] Talking about the ‘dramatic’ dimension of activity [...] means that nothing can be ‘mechanical’ in this action, nothing can be merely the ‘application’ of something planned without you, before you” (2009, pp. 221-222).

**Long-Term Sense-Making in Norms**

To simplify, heteronomy is like a moldable normative clay we can shape and renormalize, transforming abstract law into meaningful principles. 

Modern businesses, as hetero-directed spaces, don’t value renormalization as a normal process of work activity. Instead, they often use nudges to influence individual behavior, prompting people to act as desired to maintain “modern wage demands” under “governance by numbers” that excludes participation in decision-making. 

**Condemned to necessity alone, restricted in their agency, workers are bound to suffer.**
