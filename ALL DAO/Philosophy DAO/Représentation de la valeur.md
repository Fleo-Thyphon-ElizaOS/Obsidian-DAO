### Evolution of the Concept of Value

Any non-objective notion is subject to evolution over time, depending on the attributes assigned to it and the objectives associated with it. In the case of the notion of value, economic theory has significantly evolved on this topic, especially over the last two centuries, during which the general movement toward the rationalization of our societies has had a profound impact.

#### Mercantilists and the Accumulation of Goods

This economic school has left us with a term widely used in contemporary vocabulary: **mercantile**. Almost everyone is familiar with this term, which describes a person, a business, or any action aimed at accumulating wealth. This aligns closely with its etymology, as the mercantilist school was an economic theory prevalent between the 16th and 18th centuries, positing that the accumulation of material wealth was the driving force behind public happiness. It is no coincidence that this theory flourished around the time of the discovery of the New World, primarily as an economic endeavor focused on the accumulation of new lands for agriculture, the increase of labor power through the enslavement of local populations, and the plundering of wealth (especially precious materials) present on the continent.

At that time, the economy was largely practical and based on trade, making the idea of treating it as a science relatively new, with few theoretical tools available to its early proponents. They sought explanations for the wealth of certain nations/empires and the economic dominance of others. The prevailing idea was that wealth derived from the accumulation of what was then considered valuable: land for the fruits and vegetables it produced and for the livestock it supported; people for their labor, particularly in construction and agriculture; and precious materials (such as gold and gemstones) for their rarity and aesthetic beauty.

#### Physiocrats and the Value of Land

Until the end of the 18th century, the physiocrats, led by the Frenchman Fran√ßois Quesnay, maintained that value originated from nature itself. In a world that had not yet experienced its first industrial revolution, this value could only stem from the exclusive labor of the land, thus linking it to agriculture. Handicrafts and trade were not viewed as sources of value but rather as mere additions to predominantly agricultural production.

This land-based conception of value is easily quantifiable, as it merely requires accounting for total agricultural production over a given time frame. However, it is also flawed due to its dependence on unpredictable climatic conditions and incomplete because it overlooks a significant portion of economic production (manufactured goods and commercial exchanges).

#### Classical Economists and the Notion of "Exchange Value"

Starting in the late 18th century, classical economists, aware of the shortcomings of physiocracy, proposed a different interpretation of value better suited to an increasingly open economic system based on exchanges between nations. The two leading figures of classical economics, Adam Smith and David Ricardo, distinguished between "exchange value" and "use value," attempting to objectify economic value and make it more easily quantifiable, as it is essentially linked to the price of goods.

They sought to address the issue of subjectivity by shifting the focus of value toward that of prices. Thus, price became the preferred instrument for measuring value, intended to serve as its most faithful symbolic representation. This theoretical revolution had the advantage of considering all aspects of economic production, not just agricultural production, as every good or service (a still embryonic notion at that time) was associated with a price.
