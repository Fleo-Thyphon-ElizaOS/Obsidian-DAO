Blockchain technologies drive progress—*ultreïa* (Leloup, 2020, p. 7), a step further—by encouraging a deeper understanding of the world and our environment, with the goal of transforming and improving everyone’s quality of life. This **metanoia**, both individual and collective, aims ultimately to rehumanize the collective.

### Heteronomy

According to Alain Supiot, a jurist and philosopher, work **is no longer truly human if the prevailing heteronomy** denies human thought. This occurs when “human labor is aligned with the model of a machine, no matter how advanced” (2015, p. 331), or when it denies reality by “disconnecting symbol manipulation from the actual experiences underlying that symbolism. [...] Driven by scientism and data fetishism, this disconnection from reality exposes individuals and collectives to the risk of delusion” (pp. 331-332).

Scientism and data fetishism are described by sociologist Pitirim Sorokin as “quantophrenic”—the tendency to systematically translate social and human phenomena into mathematical language.

### Working for Others' Thinking

**Quantophrenia** is this obsession with measurement, ratios, and quantitative data, which leads to forgetting the purposes behind actions (Sorokin, 2005). 

**In essence, this pathology reverses the ends of praxis with the means of poiesis, substituting human goals with financial means.**

“Thus, a system is inhumane if it reduces workers to the state of beasts or machines, treating them as mere instruments of others’ thoughts. But it is also inhumane if it disconnects workers from any real experience of the realities they affect” (Supiot, 2015, p. 332).

### Dehumanization

Supiot identifies this dehumanization as a shift **from governance by laws** to governance **by numbers**, in which “faith in harmony through calculation resurged with ultra-liberal globalization and libertarian demands—the economic and 'societal' sides of the same coin. Their prophets in turn promise a world of abundance, where each will be governor of themselves, subject only to constraints they have expressly consented to” (2015, p. 292).

### Neoliberalism = Individualism

This misleading notion of the current neoliberal system, suggesting that people become self-governors, offers no alternative for escaping the heteronomous structure of a deeply neoliberal market economy; on the contrary, it **reinforces social atomization, driving individuals toward greater individualism**.

In contrast, the libertarian framework of the Internet of Value encourages more conviviality by inverting poiesis and praxis, rehumanizing human activity and positioning it as an end in itself.

### The Example of Bitcoin

Once again, to reference Bitcoin while the dominant paradigm is “I am sovereign, therefore I create money,” the new libertarian blockchain paradigm is “I create money, therefore I am sovereign.”

**Moving from financial heteronomy to monetary inter-autonomy is nothing less than Bitcoin’s purpose.**

### Dissociating Activity

Similarly, shifting from ultraliberal and libertarian heteronomy to libertarian inter-autonomy is the project of blockchains and Web 3.0, enabling a closer connection to “the knots of real work in situ, untying them in partnership with those best equipped to do so” (Clot, 2015, p. 145), as well as unraveling complex knots, in Jean-François Zobrist's sense: “An airplane [...] is a complicated system. It consists of millions of parts that must work together seamlessly. But everything is mapped out; if you change one part, you can generally predict all the resulting consequences. A plate of spaghetti, however, is a complex system. Even though it has only a few dozen ‘parts,’ it’s virtually impossible to predict what will happen if you pull on a spaghetti end sticking out of the plate” (Laloux et al., 2017, pp. 138–139).

**By untangling this intricate weave of multidisciplinary, multifactorial elements, it becomes possible to understand one’s environment and reclaim one’s self-body.**
