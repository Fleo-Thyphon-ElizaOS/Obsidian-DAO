**Libertarian Blockchains like Bitcoin or Ğ1 and their DAOs invite a Paradigm Shift in the Workplace Worth Examining through an Ergological Approach**

The aim of ergology is to gain a more precise understanding of work activities in their innovative potential within a normative context. This approach is closer to activity clinic than work psychodynamics, though it remains transdisciplinary. 

Ergology helps us grasp the influence of norms on activity and the essential normativity required to understand processes like integration and one’s relationship to work.

Philosopher Yves Schwartz, whose work has significantly advanced this approach in academic and scientific spheres, sometimes reacts strongly in his writings to modern forms of work that are **alienating, mind-numbing, and exhausting for both body and mind**, revealing rejections and refusals in the name of “life.” 

When reflecting on human creativity, Schwartz connects this with Georges Canguilhem's view on the pathogenic nature of heteronomy, asserting that “it is not truly living to be in mere reproduction, simply replicating the determinism imposed by ‘others.’ That’s not living, in the full sense—it’s pathogenic” (Schwartz, 2009, p. 17).

As we have seen, creativity essential to organizations largely depends on **collective intelligence**, which means that work and its analysis are deeply interwoven with politics, power, and collective becoming, with its various normative expressions.

For Yves Clot, a work psychologist, it is essential to create "a framework or mechanism where work can be collectively reconsidered to reorganize it” (2008, p. 73). He argues that the true response to heteronomy is initially collective, even if it requires individual involvement. This involves “getting close to the real knots of work in order to untangle them, in collaboration with those who have the means to do so” (Clot, 2015, p. 145).

Without the ability to dismantle and rebuild work activity, without any option for renormalization, Clot speaks of “hampered activity” (2008, p. 67, 97), leading to work-related suffering stemming from an inability to act effectively or to “do well,” resulting in deep malaise. 

**Every living organism’s only purpose is to grow; to hinder this purpose is, in a way, to mutilate and suppress the very life whose sole end is to expand.**

Philosopher Joëlle Zask emphasizes that “human environments are only ‘good enough’ when they **provide individuals with the means for self-development**” (2011, p. 284). She also highlights the importance of the collective aspect of self-development, inherent to life itself, asserting that “removing the contributive dimension of existence is to suppress humanity” (Zask, 2011, p. 166).

For Zask, “A group becomes more of a community when its members' contributions are personal” (Zask, 2011, p. 117). 

Development is a dual movement, individual and collective, where the personal contribution is “a meaningful part, one that influences the situation in such a way as to feed both association and individuation” (2011, p. 140).
