The value of decentralized governance through the “internet of value” enabled by blockchain technology lies not only in harnessing the “wisdom of crowds” but also in enriching it by enhancing the collective’s knowledge, coordination, and cooperation.

For philosopher and sociologist Pierre Levy, the internet is a tool that boosts humanity’s collective capacity for cooperation and coordination. Thus, as a means, the ultimate purpose of Web 3.0 tools is to foster the growth of collective intelligence.

Pierre Levy defines collective intelligence as “an intelligence that is universally distributed, continuously enhanced, coordinated in real-time, resulting in the effective mobilization of competencies” (Lévy, 1994, p. 29). This definition closely resembles that of praxis.

First, it is universally distributed, meaning no one individual can know everything, but everyone knows something. Knowledge resides in the minds of all individuals rather than in a transcendent entity that allocates it within society.

Second, it is continuously enhanced by the unique value that each member of the collective brings, ensuring everyone has a unique place and contribution within an intelligent collective. Organized in this way, the central wealth of the human collective is people themselves. Levy points out that one fundamental concept the internet embodies is the economy of human qualities.

Third, it is coordinated in real-time by cyberspace, a support and scaffolding tool for collective intelligence, enabling both public and private, peer-to-peer networked communication on a large scale.

Finally, it results in the effective mobilization of skills. Collective intelligence is not merely a theoretical or philosophical concept; it underpins an effective and efficient new social organization based on skills, knowledge, and learning (Lévy, 2008). Collective intelligence favors creative potential over power (which, unlike creative potential, isolates, divides, and weakens).

Levy, therefore, encourages disengagement from hierarchies in favor of investing in the decentralization of knowledge and power, autonomy for individuals valued as meaning-makers, the expansion of an intersubjective space free from economic and state constraints, continuous interaction between individuals and their environment (technical, economic, ecological, etc.) with real-time feedback and control, the breakdown of massive structures in favor of small, friendly, autonomous entities, and the emergence of a new conviviality and a new ethic of living together.

This conviviality enriches “relationships and cooperation, allowing for opposition without destruction, and fostering care for others and Nature” (Caillé & al., *Convivialist Manifesto: A Declaration of Interdependence*, 2013, p. 14).

From this perspective, decentralized governance would multiply collective intelligence and the wisdom of crowds, creating positive feedback loops that continuously enhance the efficiency of governance and generate a virtuous cycle within which a collective can infinitely self-perfect. The libertarian praxis of Web 3.0 must necessarily operate with decentralized governance to unleash creativity from the heavy burden of a permanent central authority. Freed from centralized power, collectives that share decentralized power have the flexibility necessary for optimal renormalization of their work.
