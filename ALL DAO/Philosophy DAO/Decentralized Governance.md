**Steering the Collective's Helm: "Gubernare," Governing to Guide the Human Ship Toward Surpassing Individuation and Inter-Individuality, Leading to Trans-Individuality: Connection, Inter-Being, Beyond the Dialogic of the Whole and Its Parts—This is a Metanoia.**

*Metanoia* signifies what goes beyond—*meta*—the *noos*, or mind, intelligence. It involves a profound transfiguration, an important, even decisive, transformation of one’s being, thoughts, and actions. In ancient Greece, the word *metanoia* meant “to adopt a different, supposedly better, standard of conduct” (Romeyer-Dherbey & Gourinat, 2001). It is a renormalization of being, a natural evolution of the living that aligns with the self-improvement of praxis.
