Renormalization as a governance norm within a decentralized autonomous organization empowers work collectives to self-determine and thus rehumanize work.

Developing capabilities in an enabling work environment aims to "be capable of working as a human being, exercising practical reasoning, and forming meaningful relationships of mutual recognition with other workers" (Nussbaum, 2012, pp. 55-57).

Among the range of possibilities offered by the Internet of Value, the potential for free, hierarchy-free interconnection that allows everyone’s voice to be democratically represented within a collective—enabling inclusive decision-making for all stakeholders—most closely aligns with the philosophy of Care by paving the way for genuine inter-autonomy.

Moreover, the ability to renormalize the economic heteronomy of neoliberalism, dominated by financial giants, by creating one’s ecosystem, a micro-economy governed by a token whose value reflects the quality of the company’s services, enables decentralization in the financialization of projects, thus bypassing heteronomous agents that stifle any possibility of renormalization.

This opens the door to a connection between individuals, a transindividuation, a "social becoming that individuates into a collective unity" (Simondon, 2002), where renormalization becomes the norm.

# Wisdom of Crowds

These alternative anarchist organizational models bring people closer together and promote collective intelligence, or the "wisdom of crowds," allowing work collectives to thrive in a "salutogenic" (health-promoting) environment, which better protects against psychosocial disorders (PSD).
