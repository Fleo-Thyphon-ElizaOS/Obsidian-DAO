Praxis is a concept that has animated the philosophy from [[Aristotle]] to Wittgenstein, passing through [[Immanuel Kant]].

[[Karl Marx]] is undoubtedly the one who has most contributed to the modern thematization of praxis **by distinguishing practice from theory, action from production, the former ceasing to be merely the application of the latter**.

This aligns with the Aristotelian conception of praxis and poiésis, the latter being defined as creation, production, or fabrication.

For [[Plato]], praxis is a kind of good and useful poiésis.

Aristotle goes further, while retaining the dimension of value that Plato attributes to praxis; he distinguishes human action from production as an end.

If the Platonic praxis is the means to achieve poiésis, Aristotle emphasizes that "praxis has no other end than itself, perfecting the agent and does not aim at the realization of a work outside of this agent: its ultimate end is nothing other than the use and exercise itself" (1962, p. 34).

One can say that to be in praxis, to live well, one must work for this good at all times, which makes praxis a permanent and infinite act. According to the philosopher Raymond Bénévent, "what gives value to fabrication (poiésis) is the quality of the produced object. But the value of an action (praxis) lies in the inflection or orientation of the activity itself: to live is a praxis (the most encompassing there is). What gives it value is **the internal orientation of living: the 'good' life, the 'virtuous' life**. Thus, we find ourselves, with praxis, in the realm of ethics (the decision to inhabit sensibly what one inhabits)" (Bénévent, 2008, p. 96).

Aristotle enriches the Platonic notion of praxis by making human action a means of self-perfection. Kant, with his concept of the categorical imperative, which denotes the fulfillment of duty and the just action that is inexorably gratuitous and selfless, adds that praxis refers to the morality commanded by the concept of freedom.

Thus, what gives meaning and dignity to an individual's life can only be found in a totality, according to Kant, as scientific knowledge alone cannot provide the sense that arises from praxis.

In the dialectical materialism of Karl Marx, for whom the true is nothing other than what is done, praxis becomes the real history of society, "the very expression of transformative, emancipatory action of humanity" (Cassin, 2004, p. 19).

Marx, in his analysis of the working society, will develop the key concept **of alienation as the prohibition of exercising thought in activity**, praxis, concerning manufacturing or industrial production, poiésis.

What ergology names, as we have seen at the beginning of this part, is the dominance of established knowledge over invested knowledge. Thus, production, alienated by heteronomy, simultaneously alienates praxis and, with it, humanity.

Poiésis is dehumanized when thought in action, praxis, is constrained. For poiésis to truly be the production of man, the latter must realize it in free praxis, making full use of the self-body and its uniqueness.

In this sense, libertarian praxis offers a solution by freeing man from the heteronomy and alienation it engenders, allowing praxis to break free from its constraints and enabling man to **reclaim this tool for self-perfection**.

**This praxis represents the ultimate struggle between the need for infinite growth of a neoliberal capitalism that psychologically and socially alienates man to maintain itself, and the finite resources of a unique planet and humanity.**

For Noam Chomsky, anarchist praxis constitutes "an endless struggle, since progress toward a more just society will lead to new understandings of forms of oppression that may have previously been hidden in common practice and consciousness" (1986, p. 81).

The philosopher Wittgenstein adds to the Marxist conception of praxis the meaning that it gives to words: "it is only in praxis, the practice of language, that a word can have a meaning" (1950, p. 48). Thus, praxis is found disseminated in the plurality of shared experiences surrounding discursive activity, as Wittgenstein writes in his _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_: "philosophy is not a theory but an activity" (2001).
