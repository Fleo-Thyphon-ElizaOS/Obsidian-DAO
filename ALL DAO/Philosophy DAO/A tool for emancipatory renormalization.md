Disintermediation allows one to free themselves from the yoke of intermediaries who exploit a dominant position in the hierarchy, while automation enables a shift in the rules of a deceptive game based on "an exclusively utilitarian efficiency model, a focus on growth that endangers nature, and a generalized commodification that renders our societies inhumane" (Caillé, Humbert, Latouche, & Viveret, 2011, p. 11). Disintermediation and automation offer powerful renormalization capabilities to all human collectives so they can decide to reconfigure the reality of the world of work.

Bitcoin serves as a prime example of emancipatory renormalization of economic heteronomy. Where currency issuance was previously the privilege of states and banks, this protocol introduces a new paradigm in which miners securing the network can create their own bitcoins by generating new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. Although initially viewed as utopian or even ridiculous, then dangerous and to be suppressed, this idea now seems evident, especially as a country like El Salvador has made it legal tender alongside the dollar, which was deemed too heteronomous for the nation, and as other countries appear to be moving towards Bitcoin adoption. Every revolution faces friction, but all are inevitable.

To quote American union advocate Nicholas Klein: "First, they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. Then they attack you and want to burn you. And finally, they build monuments in your honor" (1913).

By transitioning from institutional debt money to debt-free money belonging to the collective, Bitcoin users emancipate themselves from the heteronomy of state debt currencies. Similarly, the Ğ1 protocol, with its daily money creation distributed as a universal dividend to network members, liberates its users to a lesser extent from "material heteronomy" (Lordon, 2010), which condemns individuals to the necessity of earning a living. Ğ1 allows for a paradigm shift by raising the thorny question of universal basic income. While classical economics finds this subject complex due to the issue of financing such an income, blockchains present entirely new possibilities.

Material heteronomy and heteronomy in labor are primarily the result of monetary power as conceived by others. It is an overwhelmingly suffocating financial heteronomy for individuals. Once it becomes possible to be inter-autonomous and collectively renormalize the intersubjective realities in which the collective operates, why continue to impose norms that suit no one, given the significant social, environmental, ecological, economic, psychological, and health damages? Wouldn't the dehumanizing framework in which companies enslave individuals to create fictitious financial value be the first renormalization necessary to rehumanize work?
