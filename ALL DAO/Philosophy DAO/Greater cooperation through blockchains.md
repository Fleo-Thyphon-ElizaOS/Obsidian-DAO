Once again, technology is amoral; blockchains can be used by a libertarian collective seeking to expand the territory of private property with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which confer a unique character to digital assets such as artworks and guarantee exclusive ownership to their holders. Similarly, a libertarian collective may aim to enhance inclusion and the economy of the commons in a more community-oriented spirit (Ostrom, 2010). Likewise, these technologies can serve transhumanist ideology, which selfishly aims to enhance the individual human being, just as they can support the hyperhumanist movement advocating for greater humanism, charting a path of inter-individuation and healthy improvement for humanity.

"The real challenge today is to become EVEN MORE HUMAN, rather than transforming oneself into an immortal, super-intelligent robot. This is what I call hyperhumanism: the development in the human brain of capabilities currently inhibited by daily routines, work, and mechanical thinking. What is 'mechanical' should be done by machines, in order to free up unexplored dimensions in our brains" (Rosnay, 2016). Thus, it all depends on the users of Web 3.0 and their motivations.

The organizational transformations proposed by the value internet are multiple. This research thesis is more interested in alternative governance models than in those aimed at prolonging the current paradigm by using Web 3.0 to further entrench the market paradigm. It goes without saying that this exploration aligns with the humanistic tradition of authentic organizational development and human potential, which should not be limited to neoliberal hijacking that merely reshapes a form of domination into another equally alienating one.

Sociologist David Courpasson clearly illustrates this research axis by considering the model of the enterprise at the end of this century as "supposed to herald the end of hierarchies, arbitrary managerial power, surveillance, and strict control." For him, "the advent of cooperation, participation, empowerment, and decentralization is celebrated with great sociological studies" (Courpasson, 2000, p. 15). Although the two polarities are in constant struggle, observation tends to suggest that the market paradigm, which relegates human beings to the status of commodities, is no longer unanimously accepted in our societies.

Courpasson supports his humanistic view of the enterprise by stating that "nowhere better than in the company are initiative, competence, voluntarism, and risk-taking rewarded and valued as the essential qualities of the worker. Present in both managerial literature and social sciences of business and organization, this humanistic and liberal conception of the organization, however, obscures a large part of the current concrete conditions of managerial power" (2000, p. 15).

Nonetheless, far from being na√Øve, he laments that despite a "triumphalism that accompanies the advent of liberal organization and heralds the reconciliation of businesses and individuals after decades of exploitation, one has the right to question the real principles governing the daily functioning of organizations. In other words, the omnipotence of liberal management leads to examining whether domination has truly disappeared from the organizational horizon" (2000, p. 15). The answer is already provided by reality: domination has merely morphed into a new form of servitude, cloaked under the banner of workplace happiness.
