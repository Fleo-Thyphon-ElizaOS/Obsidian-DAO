#### Progressive Open Decentralization

One of the challenges arising from the interaction between economic decentralization and legal decentralization in the open decentralization model is the "chicken-or-egg" paradox: true economic decentralization may require the use of digital assets (i.e., legal decentralization), but the use of digital assets requires both economic and, consequently, legal decentralization. This issue is particularly acute in open decentralization models, which require fully functioning decentralized economies (compared to DeFi protocols using full decentralization models, which do not necessarily require economic decentralization).

While there are many ways to address this issue from a technical and practical perspective, Web3 systems can use a process of [progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/) and take precautions regarding the distribution of digital assets before achieving full decentralization. These precautions include, among other things, limiting transferability and restricting emissions and listings in the United States until the system is fully decentralized.
