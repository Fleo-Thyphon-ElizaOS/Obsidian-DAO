## **Cooperatives: A Model of Collective Ownership**

#### **What is a Cooperative?**

A cooperative (Co-op) is a business owned and democratically controlled by its members, who share common visions and goals. Voting rights within cooperatives are distributed equally—each individual has one vote, regardless of how much they have invested in the business. Cooperatives generally operate at cost, with the goal of increasing value for the collective’s members rather than for shareholders, as in a traditional company.

Cooperatives emerged in the early 18th century and have taken many forms since. The early cooperative models aimed to address social and market power imbalances. Over time, cooperatives have evolved as a way to create true community ownership within a business and to generate value for community members.

#### **The Origin of Cooperatives**

During the English Industrial Revolution, city workers earned low wages and had limited access to affordable, quality food. In 1844 in Rochdale, England, workers collaborated to address this problem by forming the first cooperative, known as the Rochdale Pioneers, to source quality food at more affordable prices for the community. The initial group pooled their money to open a store selling basic foods like wheat, butter, and flour. Through the cooperative, community members gained access to quality ingredients at reasonable prices, and cooperative members had a voice in governance and received a fair share of the profits.

The Rochdale Pioneers Co-op was one of the few ways a community of individuals could act in an environment where they otherwise had little power to advocate for their own needs. The Rochdale Pioneers developed a solid set of [operating principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles) that served as a foundation for future cooperatives. Rochdale is credited with paving the way for modern cooperatives, which have grown to around [3 million globally](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/facts-and-figures).

#### **Types of Cooperatives**

Cooperatives vary in their membership composition. Here are some common types:

- **Consumer Cooperative**: This is the most common type of cooperative where the business’s consumers are also its members. The goal is typically to produce the highest quality goods or services at the lowest cost for consumers.  
   - *Example*: [REI](https://www.rei.com/)

- **Producer Cooperative**: In producer cooperatives, product producers join forces to pool their products for better distribution, marketing, or production. Economies of scale help cooperative members achieve a better economic standing together than they would individually.  
   - *Example*: [Land O’ Lakes](https://www.landolakesinc.com/What-We-Do)

- **Worker Cooperative**: Worker cooperatives are owned and managed by employees. The goal is to improve worker welfare through higher wages, better working conditions, etc.  
   - *Example*: [Cooperative Home Care Associates](https://www.chcany.org/)

- **Shared Services Cooperative**: These cooperatives consist of organizations like small businesses that unite for better pricing through collective purchasing, training, and distribution.  
   - *Example*: [Ace Hardware](https://www.acehardware.com/about-us)

#### **Cooperative Governance**

Unlike a traditional company where governance ultimately rests with investors, in a cooperative, control is vested in its members. Each member has one vote, regardless of their stake.

As a cooperative grows, often into the hundreds or thousands of members, most adopt an organizational structure that helps manage operations. In a typical cooperative, there are a few key players:

- **Cooperative Members**: Members vote for the board of directors and typically attend an annual meeting where they vote on board members and bylaws that impact the cooperative’s overall direction and strategy.
  
- **Board of Directors**: Elected by cooperative members, the board primarily oversees management’s performance and may set budgets or advise management.
  
- **Management**: Hired by the board, management oversees daily operations, has the authority to hire and manage staff, implement policy, and make necessary business decisions.
  
- **Staff**: Hired by management, staff work on the cooperative’s day-to-day operations.

#### **Strengths of Cooperatives**

- **Customer Loyalty**: In cooperatives, especially consumer cooperatives, the focus on serving the community fosters a deep understanding of customers. Members’ ability to influence decisions also allows the cooperative to tailor products to meet customers’ needs, creating a unique alignment of incentives and strong loyalty.
  
- **Survival Ability**: Studies show that cooperatives have higher survival rates than traditional businesses. [Quebec cooperatives](https://ccednet-rcdec.ca/files/ccednet/pdfs/2008-Quebec_Co-op_Survival_Report_Summary.pdf) had a five-year survival rate of 62% and a ten-year survival rate of 44%, compared to 35% and 20% for other Quebec businesses. Cooperative members have a stake in the business and a voice in governance, which aligns incentives to make the business resilient in tough times.

#### **Challenges Facing Cooperatives**

In 2016, [McKinsey surveyed 600 employees](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/Strategy/McKinsey%2520on%2520Cooperatives/PDFs/McK_on_Cooperatives-Improving_cooperatives_agility.ashx) of cooperatives and public companies to better understand how cooperatives compare in various operational areas. The consensus was that cooperatives face challenges with agility in decision-making, seeking new opportunities, and talent acquisition and development.

- **Decision-Making**: Cooperatives often struggle with unclear distinctions between the decision-making roles of management, the board, and members. The board and members may get involved in daily decision-making, causing bottlenecks. Cooperatives in competitive markets where quick decisions are needed to respond to pressures are particularly affected. The democratic, consensus-driven approach at the heart of cooperatives can be a double-edged sword.

- **Pursuing New Business Opportunities**: Cooperatives are formed to serve members, making it harder to convince them to invest in opportunities with no short-term returns. Long-term investments like R&D and new business ventures are less attractive than initiatives that yield immediate rewards.

- **Talent Sourcing and Development**: Cooperatives struggle to attract and retain young, talented workers. High-performing individuals are deterred by bureaucracy and slower collective decision-making, preferring more agile companies. Not attracting talent reduces cooperatives’ ability to compete with traditional firms.

#### **Summary: Lessons from Cooperatives**

- **Community ownership** creates a strong customer base and helps the business survive tough times.
  
- **Defining which decisions are for the collective and which are for operators** is crucial. Too many decision-makers lead to slow and suboptimal decisions.
  
- **Long-term investments are often overlooked** in favor of immediate benefits, which may harm the organization’s growth potential.
  
- **Inefficient decision-making repels talent** who dislike bureaucratic processes, reducing the cooperative’s competitive edge.
