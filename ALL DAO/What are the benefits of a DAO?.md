**Fan Ownership**

Fan ownership of sports clubs is already well-established, and fan armies are becoming more powerful every day, as evidenced by the recent European Super League expedition. Networks of talent scouts around the world could collaborate as a DAO to finance promising players in exchange for a percentage of their future earnings. If fan-owned clubs took on this responsibility themselves, they could vertically integrate all scouts, agents, coaches, and managers, all funded and managed from a single DAO—the ultimate "fantasy league."

This model will likely extend to all kinds of industries: music fans will own record labels and vote for new artists, patrons will animate biennials, and theater companies will vote for new productions.

**Where is the work done in DAOs?**

As mentioned, Discord and Discourse are popular conversation spaces. Much of the remaining collaboration occurs in places like Google Docs, Notion, Airtable, Figma, and Github. While powerful platforms, none were designed for the exceptionally fluid teams of web3.

On one hand, these platforms store user information on centralized databases, and access is usually granted based on an individual's role within an organization. DAOs operate differently, with shifting roles and contributors who may wish to remain pseudonymous.

We should expect a stack of native web3 productivity tools to emerge in the coming years. This may grant permissions based on token holdings and past contributions within a community.

**What makes a DAO successful?**

**Inclusive** - anyone from around the world can join and participate.

**Democratic** - all decisions can be made by the community.

**Transparent** - every transaction to and from a DAO is public.

**Permissionless** - DAOs are unregulated and cannot be sanctioned by governments.

**Benefits:**

- A variety of individuals can come together collectively to act as a single entity.
- More individuals have a say in planning, strategy, and operations.
- As votes on the blockchain are visible to the public, token holders are naturally incentivized to act more responsibly.
- Members of a DAO can feel empowered to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share similar goals within a community.

**Drawbacks:**

- Decision-making often takes longer due to more voting participants.
- It is often harder to educate users because the collective electorate is diverse with varying levels of education and knowledge.
- More time is needed to vote or gather users due to the decentralized nature of the entity.
- Serious exploits, such as the theft of treasury reserves, are possible if the security of the DAO is not properly established and maintained.

**Types of DAOs:**

- **Protocol DAOs**
- **Service DAOs**
- **Product DAOs**
- **Special Purpose DAOs**
- **Social DAOs**
- **Collector DAOs**
- **Investment DAOs**
- **Grant DAOs**
- **Education DAOs**
- **Media DAOs**

Humans are social animals. We naturally gravitate toward like-minded people and form social groups around a common topic.

Social DAOs exist to give these groups of people a space to interact and discuss—like good old Reddit. For members of social DAOs, financial returns are not as important as exclusive community benefits such as early access to new releases, members-only meetups, etc.

**NFT Collector DAOs**

Around the world, people marveled at the skyrocketing prices of NFTs. However, this led to premier NFTs like Bored Apes and CryptoPunks being out of reach for the average person.

To overcome this, people started pooling their resources to purchase NFTs as a DAO. Flamingo DAO, a fund that has amassed 7,920 ETH and $1 billion worth of NFTs to date, was one of the first collector DAOs to make a name for itself by purchasing CryptoPunk #2890 for 605 ETH in January 2021. In fact, PartyBid was built with this very idea in mind—to allow people like you and me to buy a fractional share of a premier NFT without having to sell a kidney.

**Investment DAOs**

Investment DAOs allow users to pool significant sums of money and invest in projects that align with their manifesto (e.g., Klima DAO manifesto).

These DAOs are usually mission-driven and have a broad audience behind them. Notable examples include Klima DAO, one of the largest token-governed treasuries in the world, Bit DAO, and Orange DAO—a group of YC alumni investing in web3.

---

**Grant DAOs**

Similar to investment DAOs, grant DAOs are one of the first real applications for DAOs.

These DAOs pool funds to provide grants focused on creation and impact. A few examples include Seed Club, which builds and invests in communities like Forefront, Cabin DAO, Party DAO, and MetaCartel, which invests in DApps and consumer products in the crypto space, and Gitcoin, a DAO supporting Web3 projects with quadratic funding.

---

**Education DAOs**

These are DAOs that leverage the incentive structure of EdTech and web3 to provide quality education at a fraction of the cost for students.

From learn-to-earn models launched by Rabbithole, to introductory Web3 courses produced by Odyssey, to tools like DAO Masters that give you the tools to start your own DAO—the education DAO space is making waves by incubating the next generation of web3 builders.

---

**Media DAOs**

In a world where advertising-funded media is so dominant, media DAOs shift the power of content creation back into the hands of the very consumers of the content themselves.

A good example is Madrealities, the first interactive dating show where the community decides what happens (and who happens). Holders of their genesis NFT passes have been able to vote on distribution choices, interact in real-time with the show, and attend exclusive in-person events.

The technical progression towards digital organizations is relatively simple; however, the process is complicated by off-chain human participation, which, unlike smart contracts, are fallible, require incentives, and, most importantly, coordination. And as with traditional organizations, coordination and operational diligence become exponentially more important as a DAO and its underlying stakes increase. Like many things in crypto, the probability of hypergrowth within a compressed timeframe is high, and what might start as a small experiment among friends or a weekend hackathon project can quickly become a significant element of the DAO landscape.

A smart contract is the simplest form of decentralized automation and is most easily and accurately defined as follows: a smart contract is a mechanism involving digital assets and two or more parties, where some or all parties place assets, and the assets are automatically redistributed between these parties according to a formula based on certain data that is not known at the time of the contract initiation.

An example of a smart contract would be an employment contract: A wants to pay $500 to B for creating a website. The contract would work as follows: A puts $500 into the contract, and the funds are locked. When B completes the website, B can send a message to the contract requesting to unlock the funds. If A agrees, the funds are unlocked. If B decides not to complete the website, B can leave by sending a message to forfeit the funds. If B claims to have completed the website, but A disagrees, then after a waiting period of 7 days, it falls to judge J to render a verdict in favor of A or B.
