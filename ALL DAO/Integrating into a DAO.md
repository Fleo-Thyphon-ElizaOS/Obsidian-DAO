## **How to Start a DAO**

If the above section piqued your interest, you might be wondering **_how_** to start a DAO.

While it's not trivial, **_forming_** a DAO is easy compared to the much, much more difficult task of creating a DAO with **_sustainable value_**. Frankly, the nascency of the space means we still don't really know what an exceptionally enduring DAO looks like.

If you were simply looking to create a DAO structure for fun, the playbook might resemble the one described by contributor Jess Sloss in the tweet below:

[:](https://twitter.com/thattallguy/status/1406997587383648256)

"Sell NFTs, seed your community with cool people, create a Discord, and drop tokens. Done."

But that's really just the beginning of the task ahead. To understand how to create a DAO with real value, it's helpful to take a step back and examine the four phases involved in most DAO launches.

1. **Call to Adventure**
2. **Distribution of Ownership**
3. **Governance**
4. **Incentives and Rewards**

### **Call to Adventure**

Unlike terms like "mission" or "vision," a call to adventure more precisely describes what participants are committing to with a DAO.

Sure, joining means progressing toward a goal, but the path to get there is particularly vague and truly uncharted. Those who join embrace adversity, potential failure, and a battle against all odds within a dynamic and fluid structure.

Some fantastic calls to adventure from DAOs include:

- **KrauseHouse**, which seeks to be the first NBA franchise owned and managed by a DAO.
- **GitCoin**, which builds and funds "digital public goods."
- **FWB** (Friends With Benefits), which establishes a strong presence at the intersection of culture and crypto.

### **Distribution of Ownership**

After capturing the attention of true believers, DAOs need to distribute ownership.

This is an important task and a crucial design decision. Some DAOs start by distributing ownership via tokens from day one, as was the case with [NFTx](https://nftx.io) and [Sushi](https://sushi.com). Others have chosen to build with a smaller team first, then distribute ownership once the product or community has proven its demand and momentum. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/) are examples of this approach.

Ultimately, there are many ways DAOs distribute ownership to contributors. One approach is an "airdrop," where tokens are distributed to members based on past actions, such as purchasing an NFT. Another is through "bonuses"; for example, Rabbithole provides tokens when users discover crypto projects on its platform. Others open token purchases via decentralized exchanges, like Uniswap.

When done right, ownership distribution places tokens in the hands of individuals and organizations with aligned values who will contribute and help the DAO move forward.

**Examples of how different DAOs have distributed ownership:**

- **Squiggle DAO** required you to own a Squiggle NFT to join Discord. Later, the $SQUIG token was airdropped.
- **SuperRare** distributed $RARE tokens to artists and collectors who used its NFT platform.
- **FWB** requires members to hold 75 FWB tokens. These can be purchased on Uniswap or received via a grant.

### **Governance**

Deciding how to make group decisions is an important phase in the DAO startup process. The groups that manage this decision-making are often called "governance structures." A significant segment of Web3 passionately focuses on this topic, constantly exploring new methodologies and approaches. Even Ethereum's founder, Vitalik Buterin, recently spoke **[about](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html)** the subject.

In its simplest form, governance is a process of building the legitimacy of decisions made by the DAO or the teams operating within the DAO.

There are many types of governance structures, but the most common decision-making method is called "token-weighted voting."

In this system, one token represents one vote. Members make proposals, and tools like Snapshot allow users to indicate their preference on the topic at hand. The outcome of these votes is either executed automatically or confirmed by multisig signers.

Some governance structures end up resembling direct democracies, with members voting on most proposals, while others act more like representative democracies, where a central team with a mandate votes on behalf of the group. Governance structures often evolve over time.

The DAO version of "how a bill becomes a law" might look like this:

1. **Discussion and Shaping**: A member proposes an idea in Discord, the idea is shaped through conversation, and early consensus is built.
2. **Formalizing the Proposal**: A proposal may be published on Discourse, leading to more formal discussion and feedback. In the process, the proposal may be improved.
3. **Voting on the Proposal**: Using Snapshot, the DAO allows token holders to vote on a proposal within a defined timeframe.
4. **Executing the Proposal**: Once the vote is complete, multisig signers execute the transaction or action.

The goal of governance is to make the right decisions and move the project forward. Good governance ensures that voices are heard, legitimacy is managed, and momentum is created.

### **Incentives and Rewards**

DAOs coordinate efforts toward a goal; incentives motivate that effort. The initial rewards offered by DAOs are typically native governance tokens, which grant ownership to early contributors.

While these tokens may not have immediate market value, they represent the relative value individuals contribute to a new organization and the shared ownership of the DAO's collective value.

Of course, not all rewards are token-based. Types of DAO incentives include:

- **Symbolic Rewards**: These are the types of tokens mentioned above, granting ownership and influence to holders.
- **Social Capital**: Valuable members can be rewarded with official titles on Discord or via NFTs. Being a "moderator" or "leader" can confer social status within the DAO's limits.
- **Fiat Payment Tokens**: Contributors can be rewarded with more widely distributed currencies like USDC or ETH. This functions more like a salary as there is higher liquidity, and holdings can be easily exchanged for local fiat currencies.

While these rewards can be powerful, to achieve true scale, DAOs will need to find ways to pay contributors sufficiently so they can cover their bills.

One way to achieve this is by creating a market for the DAO's governance token. Tools like Uniswap and Sushi make this possible, but they can be complicated to use. Additionally, only extremely well-established organizations are likely to see significant trading volume here.

Instead, most DAOs will need to integrate USDC or ETH into their treasury to pay contributors' efforts. DAOs can do this by exchanging governance tokens when possible or by generating on-chain revenue. For example, a DAO might choose to sell NFTs for ETH, which can be added to a treasury and then paid out to contributors based on their contributions. DAOs can also choose to provide certain services—think blockchain development—to organizations in exchange for compensation.

How to structure rewards is a topic most DAOs spend a lot of time on. DAOs are generally less defined in this area. There is no template, structured compensation plan, or even a clear set of roles. No central HR service can make decisions regarding salaries.

In the absence of this control, DAOs reward contributors through various mechanisms, some of which have already been discussed:

- **Bonuses** reward contributors for completing a well-defined task with a set number of tokens.
- **Grants** reward contributors for undertaking a larger, less well-defined challenge with a set number of tokens.
- **Coordination Circles** reward a working group for their efforts with tokens funded by other contributors.
- **Salaries** can be paid to core team members on a regular schedule to reward their efforts. This is typically paid as a mix of USDC, ETH, and native tokens.

DAO models, processes, and tools are built day by day, often by the communities themselves that need them. There is not yet a true playbook, although Sushi and Index Coop have outlined structured approaches to **[hiring](https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushiswap-hiring-guidelines-v4/2258)** and **[compensation](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/index-coop-hiring-guidelines-v1/1665)**.

Ultimately, as mentioned above, in many cases, there are currently only one or two commonly used technical solutions for each phase of DAO needs—far from the abundance of SaaS tools competing to serve every niche.

While participating in an emerging model like a DAO has its challenges, it offers a tremendous opportunity to shape the next Internet.

## **Working for a DAO**

If you're not ready to start a DAO, individuals interested in the space can make a living by working for one. To understand how to proceed, we'll walk through a hypothetical hiring process and break down the different steps, including:

1. **Choosing Your Discipline**
2. **Finding the Right Role**
3. **Onboarding**
4. **Collaborating**
5. **Getting Paid**

### **Choosing Your Discipline**

When it comes to working for a DAO, it can be difficult to know where to start. What roles exist within DAOs? What talent is truly needed?

The good news is, it's simpler than you think. While there are certainly many variations depending on the DAO's goal itself, there are some common roles.

- **Community Managers**: DAOs are, of course, communities. This makes this role particularly important—the moderators and managers are the glue that holds the project together and helps it move forward.
- **Recruiters and Promoters**: Especially in the early days, DAOs need to evangelize, attracting great people to the project. Recruiters are valuable here.
- **Scribes**: Enormous amounts of information are created and disseminated via DAOs. Writers can be influential in clearly recording this information and contributing to marketing and traditions.
- **Artists**: NFTs have become a popular way for DAOs to generate revenue. Artistic skills and sensitivities can therefore be highly sought after.
- **Engineers**: Some DAOs have started building their own tools or other products in the Web3 space. If you're a coder or want to become one, DAOs offer an opportunity to learn.
- **Treasurers**: As mentioned, DAOs manage large amounts of assets under management (AUM). They need fiscally savvy operators to help manage and deploy their expenditures effectively.

This is by no means exhaustive, of course. Game designers, digital marketers, and all sorts of other functions are useful to DAOs.

### **Finding the Right Role**

How do you find openings in the DAO world?

The truth is, there isn't a formal discovery process; most opportunities appear by chance on Twitter, in closed Discord chats, or on crypto podcasts. While this opacity makes access more difficult, the absence of a "job board" can seem like a feature rather than a bug. People find opportunities they care about by first engaging with communities they trust.

### **Onboarding**

Once you've found a DAO you want to join, then what?

The onboarding experience tends to vary significantly depending on the DAO, although high-quality organizations often excel in this area. After all, new members are better able to contribute when they receive the appropriate context and support.

To this end, some DAOs organize structured new member onboarding calls, similar to college open house days. [Index Coop](https://www.indexcoop.com/), a decentralized asset manager that creates crypto index products, organizes weekly new member sessions and provides a detailed **[guide](https://docs.indexcoop.com/new-joiners)** called "Cooper Owl Quest" on how to get started.

**Index Coop Handbook**

User-centered DAOs like NounsDAO take a different approach. Nouns created a **[playground](https://nouns.notion.site/Explore-Nouns-a2a9dceeb1d54e10b9cbf3f931c2266f)** and opened **[tools](https://nouns.notion.site/Noun-Protocol-32e4f0bf74fe433e927e2ea35e52a507)** for members to start engaging in community work and then get funded by the community treasury.

### **Collaborating**

Once you're in, it's time to start adding value™.

For DAOs, this largely involves collaboration. Rather than a centralized management team setting workflows, the DAO's decision-making power is distributed. Everyone is empowered to express their vision for the future, and the leadership team typically consists of those who can identify the community's needs and work to address them.

This bottom-up approach is visible across the DAO landscape. For example, a team of six dedicated contributors at Sushi requested a grant to help troubleshoot users and create a multilingual customer service portal. Such an initiative is classic in DAOs—the contributors identified a pain point in the Sushi ecosystem, proactively proposed a solution, requested and received resources, and began building.

**Where is this work done?**

As mentioned, Discord and Discourse are popular conversation hubs. A large part of the remaining collaboration happens in places like Google Docs, Notion, Airtable, Figma, and GitHub. While powerful platforms, none were designed for the exceptionally fluid Web3 teams.

On one hand, these platforms store user information on centralized databases, and access is typically granted based on an individual's role within an organization. DAOs operate differently, with changing roles and contributors who may wish to remain pseudonymous.

We should expect a native Web3 productivity stack to emerge in the coming years. This might involve granting permissions based on token holdings and past contributions within a community.

### **Getting Paid**

We've mainly covered the different types of rewards DAO contributors receive in exchange for their efforts.

An additional topic to note is that DAOs sometimes tie compensation to certain KPIs. The UMA project created a framework that rewards more synthetic tokens if a DAO meets predetermined goals before a given expiration date.

While this can be motivating, there's a risk that a community over-indexes on the wrong metrics. Additionally, bad actors might find ways to game the system to maximize their contribution to certain key performance indicators while bypassing meaningful work. Whenever an algorithm or program controls access to the crown, it's inevitable that someone will try to manipulate it.
