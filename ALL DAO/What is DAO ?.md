**O is for... Organization**

To move things forward, humans have always organized into groups, tribes, squads, gangs, crews, teams, businesses, and other forms of collective action. DAOs are no different. Some DAOs are groups of developers or investors, while others are advocacy groups, companies, associations, local initiatives, and so on. In fact, almost all existing forms of organization can be reimagined as DAOs. So far, this is all very familiar.

Membership in a DAO is determined by ownership of a portion of the DAO's "token," which is issued on a blockchain like Ethereum and acts somewhat like a digital membership card, granting access to secured content, voting rights, and other benefits.

**A is for... Autonomous...**

This is where DAOs diverge from traditional organizations. Typically, an organization derives its legitimacy from a governmental body, such as the tax service, business bureau, charity commission, etc. Even for organizations where this is not the case, most will require a regulated bank account. In contrast, the infrastructure of a DAO is software that can run on any computer, anywhere in the world, without needing the blessing of a governmental department. Even the money they use is global, open-source, and outside the control of any government. (More information on this in the next section).

DAOs may not be regulated, but they are not anarchic. Like any organization, DAOs can establish their own rules regarding purpose, membership, voting, etc., with a dispute resolution service like the [Aragon Court](https://aragon.org/aragon-court).

**D is for... Decentralized...**

(adjective) / diːˈsɛntrəlʌɪzd / Controlled by multiple agents, often equally.

DAOs are decentralized in several different ways:

**Infrastructures**

The DAO software is accessible through a web browser, but its backend infrastructure consists of cryptocurrency and payment networks such as Ethereum. The Ethereum network is hosted by thousands of computers worldwide that all verify the integrity of each transaction. If one computer tries to process a fraudulent payment, it will be rejected by all others, and even if an entire continent banned Ethereum, the network itself would continue to operate normally everywhere else. In this sense, decentralization makes DAOs the most robust and censorship-resistant organizations ever invented.
