### My Personal Experience of a DAO

If I had to describe my personal experience joining Aragon's DAO as an ambassador in one sentence, I would say it's like your first week of school: you show up ready to learn and contribute only to find out that there’s so much more to learn before you can even start. There are [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AragonProject) pages, [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/aragon) channels, blog articles, and all kinds of other information to sift through so you can get up to speed before actually contributing. In my particular case, I didn’t even have a Twitter account before starting this journey. I had been involved in crypto for a while, but only on the periphery, so once I jumped in, I quickly realized how deep the waters were.

On my first day after joining Aragon's Discord, I found myself with so many questions. I knew what Aragon was from my research, but I had no idea how I was going to participate in the community. "So what do I do?" "Where do I start?" I jumped in, introduced myself, and began getting involved in all the conversations happening. This eventually led me to be invited to the ambassador program, which then led me to write this article.

Since I had very little experience with the different outlets where I could participate, that’s where it became a bit frustrating and overwhelming. To contribute, I learned everything from Twitter, Github, Notion, and Discord. Fortunately, with the help of a few friends, Google, and some mods in the Discord channel, I figured it all out and now have all the tools I need to be part of the community. The best advice I can give is not to be afraid to ask questions; everyone has been a beginner at some point, and there will always be people willing to teach those who want to learn.

Now that I’ve acclimated to the DAO, what our goals are, and the tools at my disposal, it has become very clear how I can contribute and help take this DAO to the next level. However, it took a lot of patience, determination, humility, and a willingness to put myself in uncomfortable positions to learn the things I need.

I’m the kind of person who will go above and beyond for a cause I believe in. So if that’s something that resonates with you, you should go find a DAO and see how you can be part of the community. If you’re wondering where to start, you can check out [DAOlist](https://daolist.fyi/) for a list of DAOs with their Twitter, websites, and even their member counts. This is an incredible growth period for this space and an even better time to get involved to help these amazing organizations grow and bring the future of crypto, business, and social economy to light.

### Week: More Learning, More Involvement

One of the best aspects of joining a DAO is that with the constant advancements in the field, there is always something new to learn. However, one of the most challenging things for me so far has been learning to pace myself. With so much information, it’s easy to get lost for hours and eventually burn out. However, the Aragon DAO has a large community and tons of resources available, so there’s no need to rush. I’ve taken advantage of those resources and used them as a starting point for learning and hopefully teaching others as well.

### Personal Development

When I first joined Aragon, I had a very traditional business model in mind regarding onboarding, training, and finding my place within the DAO. I’ve led businesses and gone through that process multiple times. However, I found in this new model that you find your place in the organization based on your level of involvement. Instead of someone offering you training, you educate yourself using the resources available. The knowledge you acquire will shine as you progress. My long-term personal goals for this are to eventually be a team leader for community engagement, which is why I’m focusing more on learning the ins and outs of the organization and the broader realm of crypto. That way, I can effectively communicate with the community and bridge the technical gap that exists between the average user and the development team. To help me acquire that knowledge, I’ve started watching videos on the governance models that dictate how these DAOs operate. If that’s something that interests you, I would recommend the following talk by Dr. Cathy Barrera. I found it on a resource page provided by Aragon and it’s a great introduction to governance and how it is used to help organizations become decentralized. She explains how voting systems are used to help distribute power among platform users and how to prevent that same system from concentrating power instead of distributing it:

Another excellent video I watched that goes even deeper is by Vitalik Buterin. If you want to deepen your understanding of the topic, I strongly suggest using them as a starting point:

### Product Testing

Another way to get more involved is to volunteer to test new products and provide feedback to help developers make them useful and user-friendly. Not only does this help me learn more about Aragon, but who doesn’t love being on the cutting edge of new technology?!

I also recently volunteered to go through the process of creating a DAO using Aragon. I was able to follow the entire process, something I had never done before, and provide feedback at each step. Being part of the development process is something new for me, and I think it will be essential for bridging the technological gap I mentioned earlier. By doing this kind of work, I’m not only expanding my knowledge, but I’m also getting closer to my long-term goal of being a community leader for Aragon.

### Finding My Tribe

One of the last things I learned this week is a bit more personal. As I learn more about DAOs, I naturally want to talk about these things with the people around me. Where I live, this technology isn’t well-known, which presents great opportunities but also challenges. I think the opportunities are clear: I can spread the word about DAOs and crypto and help push the movement forward. But that’s also where the challenge lies: it’s hard to talk to people who aren’t interested in the topic. I’ve tried discussing it with family members, and they are interested in what I’m doing, so they try to listen, but without any knowledge of blockchain or DAOs, I quickly start going over their heads. To address this knowledge gap, I usually direct them to some [Whiteboard Cryptos](https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteboardCrypto) videos on YouTube. They are usually short, concise, and use good analogies to help get the message across. I find this video on how blockchains work to be a nice introduction to the topic for people who want to learn:

How Does a Blockchain Work?

The further I go down the rabbit hole that is cryptocurrency, DAOs, and blockchains, the less I can talk to other people about these topics. This is where the community aspect of DAOs really shines. I’ve found that even with only a little knowledge on the subject, once you enter the forums and start talking to other members and following the links that others post, you realize you’re not the only one with something to learn. You grow alongside other DAO members, and that creates a bond between you all. For me, that’s one of the best parts so far. Finding others who are interested in the same things as you and being able to talk about it and contribute to someone else's journey along the way is an incredible thing that we should all try to do. With that said, I’ll conclude this week with one of my favorite quotes:

"Every man is a student, and every man is a teacher." - Plato

### Diving Deeper

### Week: Diving Deeper

Joining a DAO has proven to be quite a humbling experience: I find myself listening more than talking and hungry for more information every day. It seems to be an iterative process where each bit of information I learn pulls me deeper into the subject and uncovers more topics I was unaware of. Last week, I dove into the world of governance processes, learning everything from origins to the different types of voting systems and how they can be used in DAOs to decentralize decision-making. The nice thing about platforms like YouTube is that once you start watching videos on certain topics, it starts suggesting even more of the same.

In addition to that, Aragon announced [elections for some of the sub-DAOs in the Aragon network](https://voice.aragon.org/tokens/info/%23/0xa117000000f279d81a1d3cc75430faa017fa5a2e). These include an executive committee that will be responsible for facilitating community conversations for planning and key initiatives; a compliance committee that will lead discussions on risk, sustainability, and ethics and ensure that proposals meet the standards set by the Aragon network charter; and a technical committee that will oversee the development of the Aragon network code. This is a wonderful example of DAO ideology at work: entrusting the community with such vital roles to apply and vote is incredible and shows how much Aragon trusts its community. Over time, this will reveal how effective this way of doing things can be and will also help empower those involved in the growth of the DAO.

Outside of that, I’ve also participated in several calls and talks within the Aragon community, ranging from a lesson on [Vocdoni](https://vocdoni.app/)—a governance tool used in the Aragon ecosystem for voting—to a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mxfMmUDmfw) by mathematician [Pietro Speroni diFenizio](https://home.pietrosperoni.it/) on governance and different types of voting, which was extremely informative.

### More Opportunities to Get Involved

### Week: More Opportunities to Get Involved

By now, I think you’ve realized that being in a DAO is a learning experience. The space being so new, there is a plethora of information that must be learned to stay up to date, and even more created every day on emerging practices and software. Week 4 was quite an opportunistic week in that certain roles are starting to emerge that I’d either like to be a part of to learn more about or think I’d be perfectly suited for. This can be something you encounter depending on where your DAO is in its development, but your life is made up of opportunities, even those you miss, so always be ready for such opportunities to arise. Even if you don’t think you’re the ideal person, don’t be afraid to ask questions or offer help: this will show that you’re eager to learn and establish your presence in the community.

The first opportunity I threw my name into the ring for was the Compliance Committee, which I mentioned last week. I’ve run several businesses, and this seemed like something I could do. It was going to be voted on by the community, so I typed up my proposal and waited. I was the first to submit, so I had high hopes, but after a few days, others—much more qualified—applied. As discouraging as that was for me, I’d prefer they do it rather than myself. Still, as I’ve said before, if you see an opportunity, don’t be afraid to try. By seeing what the most qualified individuals have to offer, I know where I stand and what is expected in these roles. Being humble throughout this experience is key to progressing while continuing to nurture your passion.

The second opportunity I noticed while browsing Discord. Someone had applied for the ambassador program and was asking how long it would be before they heard back. One of the core team members responded that there were about 250 applications and that it was taking longer than expected to process them. This is where I saw my opportunity: in my business management experience, I’ve conducted over 1,000 interviews. I commented in the thread and offered my help, which could come in handy with the next cohort. This is a great example of filling a space as you see it to help the community thrive. Even though I may not have as much experience in programming or in some of the more professional aspects of the DAO, I still have a skill set that can help things run smoothly. Don’t be afraid to speak up and step in wherever you can!

The third opportunity I found while going through our notion of ambassador is a chance to represent Aragon on Quora. This is something I’m very passionate about and looking forward to. For those of you who don’t know, Quora is a social Q&A website where you can ask any question and have someone answer it. For me, taking on this role would not only help me learn more about Aragon, but it would help me be a bigger part of the community. I’ll be able to have an impact within our community by asking questions and relaying concerns from Quora, as well as externally by being a source of information for those who are unfamiliar with Aragon.
