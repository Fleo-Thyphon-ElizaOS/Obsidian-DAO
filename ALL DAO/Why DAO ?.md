**Focus on Function, Not Ideals**

It turns out that there are really two superfluous assumptions embedded in the notion of a DAO. One is that it is autonomous, and the other is that it is an organization. As mentioned earlier, the first assumption can be corrected by envisioning a DAO-like entity that makes decisions through democratic voting. Such an entity is not really more autonomous than a democratic regime with a constitution that is difficult to change. And democratic regimes, when functioning properly, are much better understood as being responsive rather than autonomous. 

This assumption is worth digging into. After all, don't we prefer things that are more reflective and responsive to human needs over those that are not (or things that, like wind-up toys, serve only the will of the one who sets them in motion)? While it is possible to create DAO-like entities that resemble wind-up toys, it is far more appealing to create responsive entities that can adapt accordingly based on current needs or the organization.
