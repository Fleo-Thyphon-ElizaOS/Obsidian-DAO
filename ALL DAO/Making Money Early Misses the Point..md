### **_Making Money Early Misses the Point._**

The experimentation with capital and community has already produced many impactful results. However, monetary gain inevitably comes with the backlash of speculation, greed, and adverse selection. Tokens and the governance they enable within DAOs are powerful tools when implemented thoughtfully, but when used as vehicles for capital formation without more than a superficial nod to "governance," they risk bringing undue scrutiny to this nascent ecosystem.

There is certainly merit to the wave of "treasury diversification" raises for teams that have thoughtfully considered the initial mechanics of their native token, a reasonable use of funds, and a community maturation plan around the DAO. However, token generation events are a one-way street, and once launched, it is extremely difficult to course-correct if the initial implementation does not meet the needs of the organization or the surrounding community.

Ultimately, it is about **_building something worth governing_** rather than "governance" as a driver of capital formation.

### **Final Thoughts**

The evolution of the DAO ecosystem is as chaotic as the hive minds that compose itâ€”and the pace at which ideas come and go can give even seasoned crypto veterans whiplash. Consequently, many of the problems and opportunities I have outlined above may evolve or disappear entirely in the near future. But what will not change is my enthusiasm for the ongoing experimentation and the discoveries that will inevitably arise from the collisions of capital, community, protocols, and profit.
