## **How Web3 System Components Can Enable Decentralization**

When Web3 systems are well-designed, decentralization becomes a virtuous circle rather than a vicious one. Now that we have a framework for the decentralization design challenge, let’s look at how developers can use the new Web3 components below to drive decentralization in practice:

### Blockchain Networks and Smart Contract Protocols

At a fundamental level, blockchain networks and smart contract protocols enable technical decentralization. But they can also be designed to promote economic and legal decentralization by:

- **Enabling transparency** - for example, anyone can currently see where the most digital assets are deposited and where the most fees are collected in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem;
- Serving as **open-source public goods** - everyone is free to use and test features to ensure security, foster decentralized economies, etc.;
- Allowing **portability, mobility, and** [**interoperability**](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1486010648140075015) - users retain control over their data, purchases, and content across Web3 products and services;
- Prioritizing [**composability**](https://future-com.translate.goog/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp) - elements can be programmed to interact, turning them into [building blocks](https://twitter.com/VirtualElena/status/1483861088588472326) that everyone can use.

These features collectively reduce information asymmetry risk, decrease reliance on proprietary technology in any Web3 system, and increase the importance of the contributor and consumer network over developers.

In other words, these features shift the system's value from its tech stack to its network. Since networks are more open and distributed than proprietary systems, this shift highlights why Web3 systems are better positioned than Web2 systems to achieve decentralization.

### **Digital Assets**

Web3 systems' decentralized economies are driven by two types of incentives:

- **Intrinsic incentives**, which stimulate an innate desire for third parties to participate based on the system’s underlying characteristics, such as the user base, network effects, technology, etc.
- **Extrinsic incentives**, such as digital asset distributions, revenue sharing, etc.

Among these, digital assets are the most essential tool Web3 builders have to facilitate the formation and ongoing operation of their decentralized economies, balancing incentives among developers, contributors, and consumers.

When designed correctly, digital asset distributions can create a "flywheel" of network effects where the system as a whole becomes more valuable to more users as more people participate. Unlike the "locked" network effects of Web2, Web3's digital assets allow users to shape their own experiences and benefit from their contributions.

Successful user acquisition and retention can significantly improve Web3 systems' _intrinsic_ incentives for developers and contributors, ultimately attracting more users and creating a cycle. Ethereum's growth in recent years is a prime example: from early 2020 to early 2022, the amount of digital assets in Ethereum’s DeFi protocols [grew](https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum) from just over $600 million to over $150 billion. This isn’t merely a narrative about monetary value but rather shows how developer activity created products and services that attracted users, who in turn drew in more developers and additional products and services, leading to further user growth.

In addition to potentially creating such a flywheel, Web3 network effects can provide builders with a moat against competitors who copy and redeploy their open-source infrastructure. For systems with strong network effects, replication alone is unlikely to incentivize users to switch.

Again, this underscores that the true value of a Web3 system lies in its network of stakeholders—not in its tech stack, proprietary system, or other classic moats.

### **Decentralized Governance**

The vast majority of blockchain networks and smart contract-based protocols have decentralized governance administered by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Decentralized governance and [DAOs](https://future-com.translate.goog/dao-canon/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp) offer many advantages across the three decentralization criteria mentioned earlier by:

- Making Web3 systems more secure by distributing technical control to decentralized groups, limiting the ability of any single entity to take over governance.
- Providing stakeholders with meaningful representation in decisions and ensuring long-term incentive alignment. This, along with increased security, helps make decentralized governance more effective, contributing to the health and sustainability of Web3 systems' decentralized economies.
- Supporting legal decentralization by reducing stakeholder reliance on any individual or group, mitigating the risk of information asymmetry.

When designing decentralized governance for any Web3 system, we can draw from various models developed and implemented in DeFi, such as:

**Sub-DAOs** - To streamline decision-making, several DAOs assign specific authority over certain actions (legal, financial, development, etc.) to [sub-DAOs](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1465391570144927757).

**Governance Minimization** - To enhance protocol reliability and address DAO participation challenges, some propose [minimizing governance decisions](https://fehrsam.xyz/blog/governance-minimization) or creating a structure where larger decisions require higher voting quorums.

**Incentivizing Participation** - To ensure effective DAO governance, some DAOs encourage active participation, including [delegate compensation](https://twitter.com/_PorterSmith/status/1505960487162425347). While grant programs haven’t been as effective here, retroactive reward programs can be highly effective by deferring evaluation and reward distribution until _value has been provided_. They can also foster competition and an open market if well-designed.

**Progressive Decentralization** - To guard against malicious attacks, many DAOs use [progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/), transferring more control from the development team to the community as protocol/network security grows.

Ultimately, Web3 builders must avoid giving too much power to insiders. Significant control should instead be granted to the community. Where power imbalances exist, Web3 builders should seek to delegate programs to help distribute power.

In finding this balance, Web3 builders should also establish safeguards against malicious attacks, including potential governance manipulation for profit. While off-chain governance mechanisms and multisigs (where actions require multiple signers) have commonly provided such safeguards, these approaches have recently faced [substantial criticism](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/14/sec-enforcement-against-wonderland-could-mean-trouble-for-defi/) due to their potential to undermine decentralization.
