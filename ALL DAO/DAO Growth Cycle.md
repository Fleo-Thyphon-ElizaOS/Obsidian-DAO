## The DAO Community Growth Cycle

In any organization, people are the most important resource. Even though DAOs strive to rely on technology as much as possible, they follow the same rule. To succeed, you’ll need to find a way to _attract_ talent and build a culture. You’ll need to _recruit_ the right people and keep them _engaged_.

### Attract

The _Attract_ phase involves becoming _**visible to the right people**_ on Web2 platforms like Twitter.

In recent years, content creators have amassed massive audiences by creating content that 1. their community values and 2. aligns with platform algorithms. The same rules for success apply to you here. Attention is scarce, and content is your elbow in the crowd. Make sure to incorporate it as a central element of your community’s culture.

Next, another powerful lever to attract people is the community members themselves. Group members share a piece of their identity. This _**collective identity is one of your strongest selling points**_.

Have you seen how Web3 users display exclusive NFT avatars as profile pictures? How they show off certain communities in their Twitter bios? We’re all _[“status-seeking monkeys”](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://twitter.com/packyM/status/1424715346976595972)_ constantly looking for things to enhance our individual identity. This is part of the hidden value your community can bring.

Cryptopunks are a prime example of an _[identity signaling](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/18/figma-ceo-dylan-field-talks-cryptopunks-nft-beeple-metaverse/) tool_. Having a Punk as a pfp sends a clear message: “I’m a Crypto OG,” “I’m wealthy,” “I know people.” The result is that now even Jay-Z has joined the CryptoPunk party.

At the beginning and throughout your journey, you’ll need to understand who your typical _[community member persona](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience))_ is. Who are your most engaged followers, and what are they looking for? This is about understanding what your collective identity is—that is, how members can distinguish themselves from everyone else.

In the Attract phase, pick your preferred social platform and engage with the people who matter to you. There’s no secret formula. _**Some successful creators I know spend up to 80% of their time on Twitter**_. Be careful not to burn out, though, as it’s very easy to do. Here’s a pretty straightforward tweet on growing visibility on Twitter.

Once you’ve built meaningful connections on social media (yes, with people online!), you can open a more private Telegram or Discord chat and start recruiting the most promising people.

### Recruit

_Having people who care about you and participate is the most valuable thing for your community._ A “high-quality” member is someone who is intrinsically motivated and provides support over an extended period. Those who contribute time rather than capital tend to be the most valuable and rarest contributors.

Initially, the selection of new members will be organic through the process of getting to know each other and feeling “drawn” to one another. In the long run, as communities reach dozens and then hundreds of members, curation can become more challenging. To address this, you can set up more formal screening systems.

**Some member curation processes are centralized, while others are more community-driven.** Be pragmatic with your initial choice. At SuperRare, we started with a manual, centralized selection process that helped keep curation consistent. _[FWB](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://fwb.help/)_, one of the most _[successful](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://forefront.news/creators/friends-with-benefits-pro)_ tokenized communities, uses a community-led committee to review and select applications. Holding the $FWB token is now just a prerequisite for having your application reviewed.

For even more advanced communities, a proven curation system in recent history is the Mirror _[Write Race](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://mirror.xyz/race)_. A weekly onboarding event where people campaign to receive a positive vote from $WRITE holders and gain access to the blogging platform. I tried to break it down _[here](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://twitter.com/albiverse/status/1365716128069267463)_ in February. Each week, the Write Race is a community event that generates interactions and a sense of belonging among members. Weekly participation is around 30%, which is well above the industry average for token voting mechanisms.

_See Andrew Hong’s excellent in-depth analysis _[_here_](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297/status/1415054747778920456)_._

_Note on Token Distribution:_ _**In the early stages of community building, illiquid tokens with some status attached tend to be more successful at retaining members**._ If you look at engaged or successful communities like Mirror or CryptoPunks, their tokens either have 1) high barriers to entry or 2) have been fairly illiquid for most of their history. Conversely, most fungible tokens tend to have 1) a low barrier to entry, especially in the early days, and 2) be quite liquid. Keep this in mind when using tokens to recruit community members.

### Engage

_A successful community is a “many-to-many” social environment_. This means transforming a member’s experience from a single-player to a multiplayer experience.

Find the right activity. Something that resonates with your peers and is better done in a group. But don’t lose focus. Your goal as a community builder is to get community members to engage with each other; the activity itself is secondary. This could be a weekly mix contest if you’re a music-oriented community (Disclosure’s community does this!) or a weekly onboarding event like the Write Race if you’re a fairly advanced community with a token. Other examples include communities coming together around _[NFT curation](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://whale.me/)_, _[gaming](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=http://discord.gg/rnglife)_, _[P2E](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://twitter.com/YieldGuild)_, _[trading courses](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://twitter.com/beondeck)_, etc.

**Choosing the activity depends on your community member’s persona and the community’s goal**. See it as a first step toward a longer-term goal. See it as a way for members to get to know each other. Over time, this will help the community to move and work together better. Above all, consider activities as a way to build energy and _**momentum**_ in your Discord and Telegram. The more community members interact, the greater the chances for magical, unexpected things to happen.

### Next: Organizing and Tooling

This is just the first step. You’ll know you’ve mastered the cycle—_Attract_, _Recruit_, and _Engage_—once you have a core group of people interacting consistently and increasing traffic in chats and social networks. I see these things as the main signs of a healthy community. Now, as _[Alex Zhang](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://twitter.com/alexxzzhang)_ likes to say, community building is more akin to gardening than architecture. Don’t forget to stay open to unexpected projects or ideas. Consider embracing anything that emerges from member interactions.

In upcoming articles, we’ll discuss more about tools and how Web3 can be leveraged to _**retain**_, _**align**_, and _**organize**_ your community in more or less sophisticated ways. Thanks for reading!
