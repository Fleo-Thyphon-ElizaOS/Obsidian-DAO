The truth is that there is no formal discovery process, with most opportunities appearing randomly on Twitter, in closed Discord chats, or on crypto podcasts. While this opacity makes access more challenging, the lack of a "job board" can seem like a feature rather than a bug. People find opportunities that matter to them by first engaging with communities they trust.

**Onboarding**

Once you've found a DAO you'd like to join, whatâ€™s next?

The onboarding experience tends to vary significantly depending on the DAO, although high-quality organizations often excel in this area. After all, new members are better equipped to contribute when they have the proper context and support.

To this end, some DAOs hold structured onboarding calls for new members, similar to college open houses.
