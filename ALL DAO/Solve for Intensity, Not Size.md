### **Solve for Intensity, Not Size**

Vanity metrics are ways of measuring something that looks good on the surface but doesn't translate into meaningful results. From my brief experience, "community size" is a vanity metric.

In the abstract, more people in the community is helpful. For a DAO service like ours, more people = a larger talent pool to serve clients. But more people can also be detrimental to community culture. Having 1,000 people asking "wen token sir" in Discord is distracting and ruins the culture of the mission we are trying to create.

To address this issue, we define "community" narrowly as the number of active members we have, not just the number of people in Discord. And we are not so much concerned with the size of this narrowly defined community as we are with the intensity of engagement. We want our community members to dedicate their time and energy to the DAO, not just add "SuperteamDAO" to their Twitter bio.

We still have a lot of work to do to build that intense engagement. Here are a few things we are already experimenting with:

- **Synchronous Events, Organized in Discord.** While some of these events are just free brainstorming sessions, others are more structured meetings with an agenda and specific contribution tracks. The next step is to organize fun and casual events that community members are already working on.
    
- **Welcoming Committee.** This group of volunteer members is tasked with making new members feel welcome by reaching out to them for a 15-minute call. This group also has the power to filter new member applications, ensuring they feel accountable to the community.
    
- **Tip Bots.** When members create value for the DAO, they should be rewarded. It is relatively easy to reward those who build things for the DAO (e.g., a metrics dashboard), but it is more difficult to reward those who consistently answer questions, share articles, and generally contribute to the community vibe. We do not yet have a good system for this, but I expect it to become an important part of our engagement strategy.
