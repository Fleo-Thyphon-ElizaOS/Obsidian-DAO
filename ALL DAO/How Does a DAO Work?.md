A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a community of participants who use blockchain technology to make decisions and take actions in a decentralized and automated way. DAO members can vote using decentralized voting protocols based on blockchain. These decisions are executed automatically through smart contracts, which are computer programs recorded on the blockchain, designed to carry out specific actions based on predefined conditions.

To function, a DAO requires decentralized tools to establish governance among people who do not know each other, aiming to build trust.

DAOs can be used in a wide range of applications, such as corporate governance, project management, decentralized finance, and more.  
For example, a business can use a DAO for governance, allowing shareholders or members to vote on important company decisions in a transparent and decentralized manner. A charity organization can use a DAO to manage donations and projects securely and transparently, while a group of individuals working on a common project can use a DAO to manage funds and decisions in a decentralized way.

By using a DAO for decision-making, members can be confident that decisions are made fairly and equitably, without the need for a trusted third party or central authority with veto power.

Additionally, DAOs can be designed to be resilient to attacks or failures, thanks to blockchain technology, which secures and records data immutably.

However, DAOs also come with disadvantages and risks.

For instance, DAOs can be difficult to understand and use for those unfamiliar with blockchain technology, limiting their adoption. Moreover, DAOs are vulnerable to security risks, such as hacker attacks or programming errors, which can lead to significant losses for the organization's members.

### How Do DAOs Manage Funds and Assets?

DAOs manage funds and assets using smart contracts on the blockchain.

Smart contracts are automated programs that execute actions based on predefined rules. They can handle financial transactions, access rights to resources, and voting rights for DAO members.

The DAO's funds and assets are stored on the blockchain, providing enhanced security and transparency.

### Prerequisites for Creating a Mission-Driven Organization:

1. **Belief:** Members must share a common belief in the organization's founding purpose to ensure everyone works towards the same goal.
   
2. **Committed Leadership:** Engaged members, motivated by a shared goal, naturally produce committed leadership. This was evident when Shapeshift's founder Eric Voorhees dissolved the legacy organization earlier this year.

3. **Integrated Purpose:** Traditional hierarchical structures can stifle innovation by depriving lower-level employees of resources for achieving goals. In DAOs, there is little to no command-and-control structure, allowing members to call for votes on proposals anytime. If proposals are tied to on-chain execution, a successful vote deterministically releases funds for the project or department. Thus, the DAO’s foundational purpose is embedded in the organization itself.

4. **Clear Communication:** Clear communication within the organization ensures that all members are aligned and working toward the common goal.

5. **Aligned Incentives and Performance Indicators:** To keep members working together toward the founding goal, it's essential to align incentives and performance metrics with that objective.

6. **Autonomous Individuals:** Autonomous individuals can make decisions and act independently to achieve the organization’s purpose.

7. **Established Core Values:** The organization’s core values must be defined to ensure that all members work together toward the founding goal.
