We are in 1996. John Perry Barlow is about to declare: "The Internet is made up of transactions, relationships, and thought itself."

From today’s web perspective, one might argue that only the first part of Barlow’s statement is correct. The spectacle surrounding digital assets suggests that we have reached a new level of financialization, pursuing a trajectory in which more of our online actions become direct economic interactions. While blockchain-based digital assets lend themselves to speculative financial markets, they are not the only application of the technology. During this crest of the hype cycle, we have been able to see relationships forged by new peer-to-peer institutions take root beneath.

One of the earliest applications of public blockchains concerns global digital assets. Global in the sense that they do not rely on institutions to prove they are not double-spent: the mystical cat on the moon NFT is, verifiably, the only mystical cat on the moon NFT corresponding to its token. The utility of demonstrable uniqueness also extends to types of relationships beyond direct economic exchange, leading many to reflect as much on new forms of financing as on new forms of organizations.

Yet the promise of new forms of organization aided by information technology is inextricably linked to the context of the invention of the internet. A year before John Perry Barlow’s Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, another work that would impact the political ideology of the early Internet appeared: David Ronfeldt's "Tribes, Institutions, Markets, Networks (TIMN)." The TIMN report was funded by the RAND Corporation. Darkly parodied in _Dr. Strangelove_ under the name BLAND Corporation, it is a nonprofit think tank founded in 1948, which has been tasked with informing the policies of the military, government, and industry of the United States up to the present day. Because the internet begins in this militarized context, we will start here as well.

The TIMN report creates a narrative of societal evolution in which humans have progressed through four distinct organizational forms:

(T) Tribes have the societal organization principle of kinship, clans, and lineages. (I) Institutions have the societal organization principle of hierarchy. (M) Markets have the societal organization principle of competitive exchange. (N) Networks have the societal organization principle of collaborative heterarchical exchange. Heterarchical here refers to organizations that are not hierarchical, non-ranked, or possess the capacity to be ranked in multiple ways.

As new forms of organization evolve over time, previous forms of organization "develop within their field of activity, even if that field is newly circumscribed," citing how markets have increased tax revenues to strengthen the institutional state despite reducing its participation in direct economic exchanges.

The institutional biases of the report are clear, as is the assimilation of progress to Western liberal democracy, and its narrative of societal evolution may seem reductive at best. However, its argument provides a historical backdrop to the political ideology that decentralized organizations draw upon, consciously or not. This is particularly evident in the report's identification of the most recent organizational form: networks.

The report defines networks somewhat loosely. A key distinguishing feature between networks and the organizational forms that precede them is that networks are described as **_multi-organizational_**, emphasizing collaboration among "small, dispersed, and autonomous" groups over greater distances. These groups do not necessarily share a distinct organizational unit. While networks have existed throughout history, new information technologies emphasize cooperative relationships that significantly impact institutions by crossing jurisdictions, "facilitating the growth of keiretsus and other web-distributed global enterprises, and increasingly so-called 'virtual companies'," Ronfeldt notes. Yet, the main domain of multi-organizational networks is neither the public sector nor the private sector, at least as the two are traditionally conceived. Instead, they will primarily transform a third "autonomous social sector," identified in the report as civil society. Painted in the 1995 landscape to include non-governmental organizations (NGOs), grassroots organizations, and private volunteer organizations, civil society will be strengthened by multi-organizational networks and may address issues of inequality, bureaucracy, and accessibility where previous organizational forms have failed.

The report presents a watered-down political image of networks: "While the development of institutional and market organizational forms has led to an emphasis on competitive advantages, the development of the multi-organizational network form may shift the emphasis to cooperative advantages." The flip side of this political presentation is the imperial soft power that NGOs would export globally in the following decade. For those currently working on web3, all this language may seem familiar, even if this dubious ideological heritage often goes unnoticed. By bringing ideological lineages to light, we have a greater chance of changing their course.

With the report's focus on the three-letter acronyms of civil society for organizations, NGOs, nonprofits, and volunteer organizations, a future is naturally missing: DAOs.

## A Chimerical Term

DAO stands for _decentralized autonomous organization_.

DAO comes from the imagination of how the characteristics of decentralized technology, such as global digital assets, censorship resistance, and automated actions, will change how organizations operate. Initially referred to as _decentralized autonomous corporations_ (DAC), the more generalizable term DAO comes from the Ethereum blockchain community. Based on Vitalik Buterin's _DAOs, DACs, DAs and more: an incomplete terminology guide_ from 2014, a DAO could then be described as a capitalized organization in which a software protocol informs its operation, placing automation at its center and humans at the periphery. For example, a software protocol could specify the conditions under which an organization automatically distributes capital to its members. This has led to the idea that organizational values could be automated and executed by code, a persistent idea that perhaps misleadingly suggests that tacit knowledge can be fully expressed in a software protocol. While hypothetical ideas about the term abounded, by the time a DAO moved from theory to experience, the community had largely reframed the term DAO to indicate "unstoppable" or censorship-resistant enterprises. The first DAO, called [The DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)), became one of the biggest spectacles in the Ethereum blockchain community to date when, in 2016, it raised over $150 million equivalent in ETH as a decentralized venture capital fund. However, the experiment proved short-lived when The DAO was hacked a month after its launch.

Significant initiatives related to DAOs would not gain traction for several more years. Since then to the present, DAOs have drifted from their initial signifiers to continue as a chimerical term, with the term and its implementations varying according to its cultural context. Each speculative market run, despite all its noise, creates new signals about what DAOs can be deployed for, bringing descriptive, technical, and cultural refinement to the concept in practice. While some say a group sharing a lunch bill can be a DAO, to avoid excessive generalization, the focus on DAOs will be limited to examples from the Ethereum blockchain community, despite the significance of other communities coordinating in the same way. In 2021, a DAO _could_ be characterized as a voluntary association to the operational principles of digital cooperativism. As voluntary associations, they provide an intergovernmental way for strangers, friends, or unlikely allies to come together under a pseudonym toward common goals, supported by a symbolic model, incentives, and governance. Members of a DAO may have representative ownership of its digital assets via a token, which often simultaneously acts as a governance right and a network utility.

Although many DAOs do not embrace the label of digital cooperative, one could say that DAOs adopt cooperativism as a _protocol_, that is, an evolving set of relational practices distinct from traditional corporate structures or decentralized autonomous corporations, as they prioritize member ownership. The cooperative label can be qualified as digital because today DAOs primarily act to coordinate around digital assets. However, as the concept of DAO evolves in practice, its digital primacy may fade. DAOs, as we will see, also introduce new dimensions that exceed what the operational principles of a digital cooperative theoretically encompass.

Decentralized technology ecosystems tend to describe a phenomenon through its technical products. Yet, as Ruth Catlow, co-founder of Furtherfield and the decentralized arts lab DECAL, notes, "We need to build cultures before structures." While the overview below of DAO tools provides a concrete description of the concept in practice, it is essential to keep in mind that DAOs ultimately coordinate through collective vibrations.

Nathan Schneider, Startups Need a New Option: Exit to Community, 2019

The exit to community has developed in practice through initiatives such as [DXdao](https://twitter.com/dxdao_?lang=de), which was launched with the aim of giving ownership, governance, and value of the community to software protocols. Today, with many decentralized finance software protocols guiding their development through DAOs, it has become clear that software protocols can both exit and [build with the community](https://twitter.com/VENTURE_DAO/status/1395544596550062080). Given that DAOs use software tools at an early stage, it makes sense that their early users and use cases involve the governance of digital assets, such as software protocols. The digital primacy of DAOs may be one reason why their resemblance to earlier cooperative movements often goes unnoticed.

Today, the International Cooperative Alliance defines cooperatives as "an autonomous association of persons voluntarily united to meet their common economic, social and cultural aspirations and needs through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise." A cooperative can also be defined by the structure of its legal entity, which dictates that cooperatives are not owned by shareholders but by their members. The establishment of the [Rochdale Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles), formulated by a weaving company in 1844, marks a key moment in the history of cooperatives. The International Cooperative Alliance adopted these operating principles, which still guide cooperatives around the world:

1. Voluntary and open membership
2. Democratic member control
3. Member economic participation
4. Autonomy and independence
5. Education, training, and information
6. Cooperation among cooperatives
7. Concern for the community

Although these operational principles have evolved over the last two centuries, they could easily have been formulated by some DAOs today. The principles of voluntary and open membership, member economic participation, and concern for the community translate into the examples of DAOs mentioned above. The principles of autonomy and independence and cooperation among cooperatives are essential for DAOs to thrive as multi-organizational networks, reinforcing an autonomous social sector built through inter-DAO collaboration.

DAOs could establish more thoughtful standards around democratic member control, which cooperatives generally define as one member, one vote. Most DAOs use symbolic voting, that is, one token, one vote. DAOs explain that token ownership represents a stakeholder, with the token model often being directly economically linked to the DAO, for example through fees on the software protocols it owns. This allows DAO members with greater financial stakes to have proportionately more influence. Symbolic voting does not directly contradict cooperative principles, as some cooperatives weight votes based on qualities such as production. In some cases, this may seem appropriate, but as some DAOs evolve toward maintaining core infrastructures, such inequality becomes clearly undesirable. This is partly explained by the fact that not all stakeholders have the purchasing power representative of their participation and that their practical knowledge may be excluded from governance. This should be resolved by evolving the culture toward more decision-making mechanisms that dissociate economic interest from governance rights.

So far, projects such as the Tornado Cash privacy protocol have addressed this distribution issue by retroactively sending tokens to previous users, aiming to make users stakeholders of the protocol. The [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/), a public blockchain for ecosystem services, adopts another approach to this distribution issue. They have set aside 30% of their tokens for land stewards, climatologists, and other stakeholders in regenerative land management to form [community DAOs](https://medium.com/regen-network/community-stake-governance-model-b949bcb1eca3) that participate in the governance of the network. Since tokens can be distributed more easily than traditional business interests, memberships, or shares, this creates the possibility of a new form of token-holding society, which can incorporate deeper practical knowledge into governance without increasing operational transaction costs. Actors with practical knowledge, or "tacit" knowledge, such as land stewards in the case of Regen Network, benefit governance by incorporating informal practices into decision-making. Here, DAOs begin to introduce new dimensions that exceed what the operational principles of a digital cooperative theoretically encompass. For this reason, much innovation and focus should be placed on token distribution mechanisms that identify broader stakeholder participation rather than on decision-making mechanisms.

The tokenization of online communities could be the subject of a longer debate. Far from being the best answer to the problems of 2.0 web social media, tokenization introduces greater awareness of financialized relationships. As a guiding star, web3 applications could aim to introduce value into relationships that have historically been denied it, such as work and the environment, rather than creating new financialized relationships. In this context, for DAOs tasked with creating economic value, a token becomes a useful mechanism on three fronts:

1. Seed funding
2. Distribution of governance rights
3. Alignment of the DAO ecosystem

Tokenization introduces a powerful _cultural_ norm in startup organizations: the expectation of transparent co-ownership of its assets from the outset. The tension between more traditional corporate structures that pay dividends and DAOs persists. Given that most DAOs represent governance rights through a token, in a sense, tokens have the capacity to directly transpose the principles of cooperative Trojan horses into highly financialized spaces. These are two important sides of the same coin, literally, and for this reason, tokenization should not be dismissed. Tokens can be a key to unlocking the economy of ownership, but to achieve a more equitable version of that future, we must engage in shaping the culture around the distribution, mediation, and governance of tokens now. This becomes important because, unlike shares in cooperatives, many tokens that also serve as governance rights can be sold on secondary markets. While this facilitates entry conditions into an organization, DAOs can learn from cooperatives' long-term emphasis.

Just as DAOs can learn from the case studies of cooperatives, in a two-way exchange, DAOs could introduce more forms of decentralized governance into cooperatives. This is the case with Morshed Mannan in Fostering Worker Cooperativeswith Blockchain Technology: Lessons from the Colony Project, who cites how cooperatives often face "coordination problems when the entity extends beyond borders," with a "negative trend in participatory management, mutual oversight, and solidarity" as they internationalize. The dilemmas faced by cooperatives, such as financing, governance, and alignment between jurisdictions, are directly addressed by DAOs. By adopting cooperativism as a _protocol_ rather than as a corporate structure, DAOs could, in their neologism, encourage a cultural space that can be designed beyond traditional divides.

## The Golden Age

Even if DAOs may inadvertently adopt the operating principles of the cooperatives that preceded them, they also slyly resemble enclaves of other online cultures. They have the most to learn from guilds in massively multiplayer online games (MMOs).

When computer role-playing games were brought online in the 1990s, it meant that a large number of players could share a game world: an environment with a wide range of goals, activities, and side quests. The early integral examples of MMOs include The Realm Online, Ultima Online, and EverQuest, leading to more classics like World of Warcraft and EVE Online. In many of these examples, players are largely free to set their own goals, freely guided by the narrative, affordances, and risks of the open game world, and because of this narrative freedom, players form groups to achieve common goals beyond the reach of individual players. Generally called guilds, clans, or alliances, these groups can range from 40 to 1,000 participants, and their goals may include defeating tough enemies or building useful tools.

To achieve these goals, cultural models emerge within guilds, and there can sometimes be a gap between the tools that game world developers publish for guilds and their actual needs. In an example from EVE Online, game world developers created an interface allowing players to create corporations for distributing shares. In practice, this share distribution feature was rarely used as it did not enhance existing cultural models. Instead, using the game browser and EVE Online's data API, many guilds developed their own necessary tools to achieve specific goals. A parallel between gaming guilds and DAOs could be drawn here, as the current wave of DAOs tends to use a combination of composable tools, such as the voting platform Snapshot bridge to a Gnosis Safe multi-signature account.

While the specific functionality for distributing corporate shares may not have taken off in EVE Online, gaming guilds frequently adopt economic redistribution practices. The great importance of MMO markets, from [Varrock](https://runescape.salmoneus.net/archived-projects-and-content/site-content/tips/world-1-trading.html) to [goldfarming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming), will be the subject of a later essay, but one economic practice may be very relevant for DAOs: dragon kill points (DKP). Historically deriving its name from the time when dragons were the most frequently encountered enemies in MMOs, DKP emerged as a system of allocation within and sometimes between guilds.

Complex and sustained missions undertaken by guilds, such as killing a dragon, are generally called raids and can last from several hours to several days. At the end of a raid, the defeated enemy drops in-game items called loot, and guilds must decide how to distribute it. Since guilds require diverse and complementary skills from players over long periods, "it is important that the same people work together again" and it is important that guilds distribute the loot in a way that members perceive as fair. As guilds mature, they often develop different systems of loot distribution, starting with random distribution, evolving to participation-weighted random distribution, and generally arriving at distribution via an informal rating system like DKP. DKP acts as a private currency, distinct from existing currency in a game world, and guild members earn them based on their participation in raids. Members of the guild can then choose to spend these points in exchange for loot after a raid.

Originally designed by a guild in 1999 for the MMO EverQuest, the [DKP practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_kill_points) has been adopted by many guilds in many game worlds, albeit with slight adjustments. Ed Castranova and Joshua Fairfield detailed an example in Dragon KillPoints: A Summary Whitepaper: the Leftovers DKP system, which maximizes the number of participants in the system unrelated to a specific guild. As Castranova and Fairfield write, "Indeed, this organization is effectively the highest allocation body of the population. If there is an emerging government on [the World of Warcraft server] Silver Hand, it is The Leftovers." The Leftovers DKP system arises from some limitations: loot can only be picked up the day after the battle and, in World of Warcraft, cannot be transferred between players. The Leftovers DKP system has a small group of informally appointed governors: players who laboriously, through public dialogue, define and maintain a database of loot item prices in DKP. When loot drops, players with DKP can choose to spend it on a specific item, with all offers and transactions being public, spent in a zero-sum manner on all other guild members who participated in the raid.

As Castranova and Fairfield note, DKP complements the existing currencies of a game world, both for efficient allocation and social cohesion, "making possible the exchange of time (spent on these raids where an individual is not compensated) for goods (obtained in the raids where an individual earns loot)." Especially in the case of World of Warcraft, because loot cannot be transferred between players, having loot also serves a strong signaling function, showing that a player has participated significantly in raids over time. This DKP system precedes the mechanics of the DAO platforms currently being developed today, such as Aragon, Colony, and DAOstack, all of which offer mechanisms for distributing reputation tokens based on member participation, which are rewarded for successful proposals, grants, or campaigns—what could be called raids in other game worlds. These reputation tokens complement other economic systems enabled by DAO platforms, such as DAO-specific tokens or other assets in their multi-signature treasury accounts. Often used as an alternative model to the ploutocratic model of one token, one vote, reputation tokens earned through participation rather than purchasing power offer greater voting power in DAOs that accumulates over time. DAOs can learn from DKP, which, in turn, acts as a participation-based private currency that can be spent on other digital assets, rather than only accumulating over time.

In addition to functions of efficient allocation, contextual reputation, and signaling, the DKP system has another significance for DAOs: generally, all guilds resolve disputes independently of traditional judicial systems, despite these disputes involving costly stakes. This becomes very relevant for DAO tools like Aragon's digital jurisdictions or the decentralized arbitration service [Kleros](https://kleros.io/) that aim to provide native dispute resolution tools on the Internet. In fact, DAO tools often attempt to technically solve problems that gaming guilds have already culturally refined over several decades, and it may be time for DAOs and gaming guilds to more closely merge their practical knowledge.
