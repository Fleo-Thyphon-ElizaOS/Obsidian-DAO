As mentioned, Discord and Discourse are popular conversation places. Much of the remaining collaboration takes place in places like Google Docs, Notion, Airtable, Figma, and GitHub. While these platforms are powerful, none have been designed for the exceptionally fluid teams of web3.

On one hand, these platforms store user information on centralized databases, and access is typically granted based on an individual's role within an organization. DAOs operate differently, with changing roles and contributors who may wish to remain pseudonymous.

We should expect a native web3 productivity stack to emerge in the coming years. This could grant permissions based on token holdings and past contributions within a community.
