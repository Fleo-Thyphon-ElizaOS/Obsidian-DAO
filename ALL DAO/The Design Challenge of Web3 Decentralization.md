## **The Design Challenge of Web3 Decentralization**

Decentralization can be viewed as a unique design challenge encompassing three different but interdependent elements: **technical**, **economic**, and **legal**. Understanding the differences between these elements is essential for designing Web3 systems, as design decisions regarding one affect the others.

### Technical Decentralization

Technical decentralization primarily concerns the **security** and **structural mechanisms** of Web3 systems. The main innovation behind programmable blockchains is that they can support technical decentralization by providing a permissionless, trustless, and verifiable ecosystem in which value can be transferred—and, importantly, on which Web3 products and services can be **built**.

This means that products and services can be deployed and operated without the need for centralized trusted intermediaries to run them (or undermine them), opening up a vast world of possibilities. For these reasons, technical decentralization serves as the **foundation** upon which the other two types of decentralization can occur: economic and legal.

### Economic Decentralization

Economic decentralization pertains to the **economics** of Web3 systems. The advent of programmable blockchains (such as Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche) and digital assets (such as ETH, SOL, and AVAX) has unlocked the ability of open-source and decentralized systems to finally have their own **decentralized economies** (i.e., self-sustaining free market economies).

This is a critical breakthrough. The open-source and decentralized protocols of previous generations of technology like Web1 (such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP, etc.) stagnated because they lacked the capacity to incentivize ongoing development and/or additional investment of critical resources into their systems. This left fertile ground for centralized Web2 companies to emerge and succeed, as they could leverage their efficiency and resources to create products and services that outperformed those of Web1. But this centralization also led to countless examples of abuses of user rights, de-platforming, and aggressive participation rates.

Today, the technology underpinning Web3 allows for the creation of much more sophisticated open-source and decentralized systems—and enables decentralized economies to form around them—allowing Web3 products and services to compete with and eventually surpass those of Web2.

Web3 system builders can facilitate the formation of decentralized economies through careful design decisions that enable their systems to accumulate "value"—whether it be information, economic value, voting power, or another form—from a wide range of sources, and to distribute that value fairly among system participants based on their contributions. To achieve this, Web3 systems must confer meaningful power, control, and ownership to system stakeholders (through airdrops, other token distributions, decentralized governance, etc.). This, in turn, encourages stakeholders to contribute significant value, as they have a say in how their contributions are treated and rewarded.

The ongoing balancing of incentives among stakeholders—developers, contributors, and consumers—can then generate new contributions of value to the overall system, benefiting everyone. In other words: all the benefits of modern network effects, but without the pitfalls of centralized control and captive economies.

## **Legal Decentralization**

Legal decentralization pertains to the **legality** of Web3 systems. In this article, I focus primarily on U.S. securities laws, which dictate how and if Web3 systems can utilize their own native digital assets. While there is no codified standard of "legal decentralization," an analysis of first principles of U.S. securities laws, case law, and SEC guidance (including the [SEC's definitive guidance](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/%2520framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets%23_edn1) from April 2019) can help us formulate a practical standard.

To begin, U.S. securities laws generally aim to create "fair rules of the game" for securities transactions by limiting the ability of those with more information to exploit others with less information. This is the principle of **information asymmetry**, and U.S. securities laws generally seek to eliminate asymmetry in certain securities transactions by imposing disclosure requirements. This principle plays a role in the _Howey test_, the subjective test that determines whether U.S. securities laws should apply to a digital asset transaction when there is (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with a reasonable expectation of profit (4) primarily based on the efforts of others' management. The fourth prong aims to address information asymmetry based on the belief that where reliance is placed on "management efforts," the risk of information asymmetry (of managers relative to outsiders) is likely high, and thus the application of securities laws may be necessary.

Based on the above and SEC guidance, we can assume that if a Web3 system can (a) eliminate the risk of significant information asymmetries and (b) eliminate reliance on essential management efforts of others to ensure the success or failure of that enterprise, then the system _may_ be "sufficiently decentralized" such that the application of U.S. securities laws to its digital assets is not necessary. For the purposes of this article, I refer to these systems as **legally decentralized**. Certainly, the legal threshold of decentralization may not be attainable by most enterprises, but as I explain below, the new components of Web3 systems uniquely position them to reach such a threshold.

Collectively, these three distinct aspects of decentralization—technical, economic, legal—must be considered holistically, as a unique design challenge, because design decisions regarding one will affect the others. Generally, the interaction between **technical**, **economic**, and **legal** is primarily **additive** rather than subtractive—**developments in one create more possibilities in the others**. For example: decentralized economies help drive systems toward legal decentralization by prioritizing decentralized ownership among stakeholders, increasing value from decentralized sources, and distributing value to decentralized stakeholders. All of these elements reduce the risk of information asymmetries and the need to rely on individual management efforts.
