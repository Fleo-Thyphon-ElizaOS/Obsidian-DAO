Originally, DAOs are about pooling risks and rewards and leveraging the stability that results from these economies of scale. No industry understands this better than insurance, so it's natural to expect that companies managing risks will start exploring how DAOs can mitigate their exposure.

## **UnoRe**

[UnoRe](https://unore.io/) [is partnering with Aragon](https://blog.aragon.org/uno-re-pioneering-the-reinsurance-dao/) to develop a reputation-based DAO to manage a reinsurance system, where insurers transfer portions of their risk portfolios to other parties to reduce the likelihood of having to cover a significant payout resulting from a claim. Reinsurance is a vast asset class but has historically been very difficult to access for anyone other than the largest investors.

Uno Reâ€™s broader vision is to create a platform for innovative insurance products, offer retail investors access to risk pools, enable traders to buy and sell risk instruments, and eventually establish a market for independent actuaries.
