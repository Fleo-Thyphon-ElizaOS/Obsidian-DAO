### **Formation**

To participate in a DAO, there must first be a DAO.

Several projects are currently competing for supremacy, including Aragon, Syndicate, Orca, Tribute, and Colony. These are not always direct competitors, as each solution offers a unique value proposition and a set of distinct features.

What are these projects _for_? A simple way to view them is as a crypto-native version of [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas)—they enable DAOs to take off. This includes elements such as member management, treasury tools, and governance infrastructure.

In the coming years, we should expect to see more products entering the market to support the formation of DAOs. Just as white-label solutions are used to manage tasks like content management, we will soon reach a point where a multitude of options exist for new DAO builders.

**Aragon**

Founded in 2016, [Aragon](https://aragon.org/aragon-association) provides a suite of applications to create, manage, and govern DAOs at scale. This includes Aragon Court, Aragon Govern, Aragon Voice, and Aragon Client. As one of the first teams dedicated to DAO infrastructure, the Aragon Association has become a significant service provider for DAOs, claiming notable projects like LidoDAO as users.

**Syndicate**

Contributor Will Papper is a co-founder of [Syndicate](https://syndicate.io/), a decentralized investment protocol and social network focused on investment DAOs. Its mission is to democratize the world of investment by allowing individuals and communities to launch investment vehicles much faster and at a lower cost than traditional funds. Syndicate's solution includes legal assistance and social network protocols that enable investor communities to come together, communicate, and deploy capital.

**Orca**

DAOs often struggle to maintain high participation rates at scale. [Orca Protocol](https://www.orcaprotocol.org/) has an intelligent solution for this, while reducing bottlenecks in deploying funds and resources.

Specifically, Orca operates a "pod model" in which a single monolithic treasury is replaced by smaller "pods," each with its own sub-member and wallet. Essentially, each pod functions as a mini-DAO within a larger DAO structure.

This is a significant unlock, bringing composability to DAOs by creating the infrastructure that allows pods to attach and detach as needed, somewhat like DAO legos. It also reduces the size of groups, making coordination and engagement easier.

**Tribute**

Part of the MolochDAO ecosystem, [Tribute](https://tributedao.com/) provides a framework of open-source solutions that DAOs leverage to scale better. Its tech stack includes solutions for canceling proposals, creating non-voting shares, expelling members, using NFTs for membership, whitelisting tokens, and much more. Tribute is fundamentally modular, allowing DAOs to choose the solutions they need.

**Colony**

Inspired by ant colonies, [Colony](https://colony.io/) offers a collection of Ethereum smart contracts to start a DAO without any coding required. Colony simplifies governance, authority, compensation, and more.

The colony itself is maintained by the meta-colony—a DAO that has yet to be unveiled. The meta-colony will continuously develop and maintain tools for those operating the colony infrastructure.

### Communication

Once a DAO is formed, it must facilitate communication among its members. Healthy discussion is, of course, key to information sharing, which paves the way for good voting practices, treasury management, and broader coordination. No DAO wants to become a Quiet Place.

A number of tools have emerged to facilitate conversation, including Discord, Telegram, and Twitter.

![Image](file:////Users/sebaastiencailhol/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image003.jpg)

**Discord**

Discord is arguably the primary means of communication and coordination for DAOs. For those who haven't yet ventured into the world of Web3 servers, Discord is a free voice, video, and text discussion platform that has quickly reached omnipresence in the ecosystem.

Its features make it particularly appealing for DAOs. On one hand, starting a Discord is relatively simple, and due to its channel and sub-channel architecture, organizing communication is straightforward and flexible. (Even if this doesn’t completely quell the chaos.)

Critically, as Discord has become the default in Web3, a number of useful bots and plugins have emerged to support it. The main among them is the "token-gating" feature. As previously mentioned, some DAOs restrict access to those holding a certain amount of native tokens. For example, if we were to launch RandomDAO, we might insist that anyone wishing to join Discord must hold 420 $RANDOM tokens.

Tools like Collab.Land allow DAOs to ensure that access to private chats is granted only to those meeting token requirements. Other widely used bots include MEE6 and Statbot.

Additionally, it’s worth noting that Discord integrates well with existing sites; as more and more communities transition to DAOs, expect this to become an increasingly vital feature.

**Telegram**

The most common alternative to Discord is Telegram. While popular among the crypto crowd, the chat app has not seen the same adoption by DAOs as Discord. This is largely because Telegram does not offer the same level of granularity, particularly regarding bots and sub-channels.

However, perhaps due to its relative simplicity, Telegram _is_ often fertile ground for DAOs just getting started, before transitioning to Discord.

**Twitter**

"How is Twitter still free?" is a running joke among the platform's most avid users, for good reason. In many ways, Twitter has become something of a public good, especially in the world of crypto. The amount of information and knowledge that flows through this platform on any given day is remarkable, and its supremacy as the de facto social graph of the industry has cemented its importance. (Others are vying for that throne, of course.)

While Twitter does not meet the high-volume private chat needs of DAOs, it remains an important communication tool in the ecosystem—especially for discovering new projects—and we would be remiss not to at least acknowledge it.

### Coordination

One of the biggest challenges for any collective, whether a local community or a multinational, is coordination, especially at scale. Historically, we have used hierarchies to manage this issue, but what is the best solution in a flat, decentralized structure?

DAOs rely on a number of different tools to manage their community and optimize coordination, including Coordinape, Collab.Land, SourceCred, and DAOhaus.

![Image](file:////Users/sebaastiencailhol/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.jpg)

**Coordinape**

Used by bluechip DeFi protocols like Yearn and Sushi, [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) helps DAOs coordinate and distribute resources to contributors.

For example, Coordinape's product "Circle" allows DAO contributors to "gift" a limited number of GIVE tokens to those they believe are adding value to the organization. While this has the advantage of being fun and rewarding participation, it also creates a de facto "merit map," illustrating who is driving the project forward. Additionally, the reward process is functionally decentralized, as anyone can choose to reward anyone.

Critics of this mechanism argue that peer-to-peer compensation can lead to a popularity contest in which the loudest and most extroverted members receive disproportionate allocations.

**Collab.Land**

[Collab.Land](https://collab.land/) offers a token management bot for Discord and Telegram. It is also useful for assigning roles to DAO members on either platform. Due to its relative ease of use, Collab.Land has become a widely used tool in the industry and is expected to see increased adoption as the number of DAOs grows.

[Guild](https://www.guild.xyz/), while not yet fully launched, is an alternative with a similar feature set.

**SourceCred**

DAOs use [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/docs) to measure and reward individuals' contributions to a project. Those who add value to a DAO through their efforts earn "cred," based on parameters defined by the organization. Cred is a powerful way to simply quantify the reputation and work of contributors.

DAOs can also issue "grain" along with cred, which can be used as a salary equivalent. SourceCred distinguishes between tokens by noting:

_If cred answers the question "who provided value?", grain answers "how should we reward people given the value they provided?"_

[**DAOhaus**](https://daohaus.club/docs/users/hub)

[DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/) is a "no-code" platform for launching and running DAOs based on a framework built by MolochDAO. The platform allows users to coordinate through a central hub where they can check activity, governance proposals, and treasury health. Membership can also be managed from here.

Since the platform is based on the MolochDAO structure, DAOhaus users can access all the tools provided by this parent organization, with the benefits of a user-friendly wrapper.

### Compensation

Let’s shift gears and talk about _how_ DAOs compensate contributors. As we mentioned, some offer payment features as part of a larger DAO suite, but specialized offerings also exist. [Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/) and [Sablier](https://sablier.finance/) are particularly

 notable.

One way to think about these tools is as "payroll for DAOs." They help DAOs manage payments on a recurring basis, on-chain, with minimal gas fees.

For those new to crypto, much of the terminology in this space can seem confusing. The important thing to note about these projects is that they enable DAOs to easily pay contributors on-chain.

![Image](file:////Users/sebaastiencailhol/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image005.jpg)

**Superfluid**

[Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/home) is a protocol that enables programmable cash flows. Using its unique ERC-777 standard, you can define "value streams" so that compensation is automatically transmitted to contributors of a DAO, continuously. It’s akin to setting up your company’s payroll so that instead of being paid twice a month, your employees are paid live, for every _second_ worked. All this happens without any further intervention on your part.

**Sablier**

Like Superfluid, [Sablier](https://sablier.finance/) is a financial streaming platform. Launched in 2019, Sablier supports all ERC-20 tokens and does not charge fees for using the contract.

A remarkable feature of Sablier is that it is genuinely autonomous. The team that created the project has burned the administrative keys that control the layer 1 contract. This means that the creators of Sablier no longer have the ability to stop the creation of new streams. It is, in the words of founder Paul Razvan Berg, "a 100% decentralized public good."

### Governance

Resolving governance and coordinated decision-making at scale is one of the most difficult problems facing DAOs today.

Why is it so challenging?

One of the major unlocks of Web3 is its resistance to censorship and its "permissionless accessibility." In other words, anyone, anywhere, can transact with one another or engage in decentralized protocols and applications without third-party interference. No government should be able to prevent you from joining a DAO, for example. (At least, in theory.)

This permissionless access can sometimes be a double-edged sword, especially as DAOs grow and evolve. Without strict caps on membership, DAOs often become larger and more diverse over time. Ultimately, popular DAOs may have tens of thousands of members, each bringing different skills, experiences, values, opinions, and backgrounds to the table.

To be clear, this is a good problem to have. That Web3 allows individuals to transition from worker status to ownership is one of its most fundamental and compelling attributes. But as communities become increasingly decentralized, the need for robust governance increases—otherwise, you risk ending up with a fragmented organization where each participant is just shouting into the void.

Several teams are frantically working to solve this issue, creating tools that help organize and motivate members. Snapshot and Discourse are two deceptively powerful products widely used in the space.

![Image](file:////Users/sebaastiencailhol/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image006.jpg)

**Snapshot**

[Snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.org/) is an off-chain, gasless voting platform primarily used by DAOs that issue ERC-20 and ERC-721 governance tokens. High gas fees on Ethereum prevent on-chain governance for all but the largest token holders.

Snapshot exploded in popularity by providing an easy-to-use, low-cost method for participating in governance. Essentially, DAO contributors can visit their organization’s Snapshot page, see the topics to vote on, and weigh in. For example, here are the proposals the Sushi community recently voted on.

![Image](file:////Users/sebaastiencailhol/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image007.png)

Snapshot page for Sushi

With some notable examples, like MakerDAO, most token-DAOs now integrate Snapshot voting into their governance processes. It’s worth noting that “[SafeSnap](https://docs.snapshot.org/plugins/safesnap),” a product made by Gnosis (discussed below), enables on-chain execution of off-chain voting. To do this, it leverages the combined power of Snapshot and Gnosis Safe.

What does that mean?

Essentially, DAO participants can still vote off-chain—saving on gas fees—with the results then transparently enacted on-chain later, without the risk of interference.

**Discourse**

[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) forums are like the "senate" of DAOs, serving as a place for formal discussion and feedback on proposals. Discussions and debates surrounding governance proposals can take place in secondary channels such as Discord, Telegram, or even Twitter, but submissions often end up on Discourse for more focused and lengthy discussion. Given their more formal function, Discourse forums also serve as archives for discussions and proposals related to the DAO.

Aave Discourse Page

### Treasury

Many community DAOs require members to commit initial capital to participate. This capital is then pooled into the DAO’s "treasury." Like traditional companies, DAOs want to manage their assets effectively and, hopefully, increase their holdings. To this end, many invest their treasury in digital ecosystem assets, including NFTs, social tokens, crypto projects, etc. In essence, they act as decentralized investment funds.

Lest you think such experiments are of insignificant scale, it’s worth noting that DAOs collectively manage **tens of billions of dollars today**. These are significant entities with complex needs.

![Image](file:////Users/sebaastiencailhol/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image009.png)

OpenOrgs

Most DAOs have ambitious plans, but wise management can be challenging. For starters, the crypto sector is extremely volatile. As asset prices rise and fall, a DAO’s assets can reasonably move by 20% or more on any given day. To protect against these fluctuations, DAOs need to diversify.

Llama, Parcel, Coinshift, and Gnosis are designed to give treasury managers the tools and information they need to manage such turbulence.

![Image](file:////Users/sebaastiencailhol/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image010.png)

**Llama**

[Llama](https://llama.community/#/) is a DAO that focuses exclusively on assisting other DAOs (meta!) in managing their treasury. LlamaDAO has gained significant clients coordinated through Gitcoin grants. It has created dashboards, reports, treasury management guidelines, coordinated sales, and financial statements for protocols like Aave, PoolTogether, Uniswap, Gitcoin, and FWB.

**Parcel**

[Parcel](https://parcel.money/) is a treasury suite used by some of the largest DeFi DAOs, including Aave Grants, Compound Grants, and Synthetix. Currently in closed beta, Parcel serves 8 DAOs and has been used to issue $3 million in bulk payments for various programs. As DAOs evolve, they will need the solutions provided by Parcel to manage the flow of funds to grant recipients, pay contributors, and effectively deploy their treasury.

**Coinshift**

[Coinshift](https://coinshift.xyz/) aims to solve a similar problem. So far, the project has garnered support from heavyweights like Consensys, Messari, Uniswap Grants, and Balancer Grants. The company has raised funds from Sequoia, Ethereal Ventures, Weekend Fund, and others. As of January 2022, Coinshift supported 247 “vaults” holding $1.6 billion in assets.

**Gnosis**

[Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis.io/safe/) is a service developed by GnosisDAO that offers a better user experience for DAO multisig wallets.

What is a "multisignature"?

It’s simply a wallet that requires multiple signatures for a transaction to be approved. Instead of one person being able to authorize a payment, multiple parties are required. DAOs traditionally use this framework to manage funds, protect against abuse, and decentralize power.

Unlike some alternative solutions, Gnosis Safe supports ERC-20 and ERC-721 assets, allowing DAOs to hold NFTs in a multisig wallet. Given that many NFTs have experienced huge price appreciation, a solid treasury tool has become increasingly important here.

### Other Notable Organizations

DAOs have the potential to bring the next 100 million users, or more, to Web3. As a fundamental structure for organizational development and deployment, DAOs will reveal new ways to coordinate personal and professional commitments, rethinking how we function and make decisions as a collective, together.

As the tools and tactics mentioned above come together, it’s worth highlighting some popular projects that have brought them to life.

![Image](file:////Users/sebaastiencailhol/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image011.jpg)

**PartyDAO**

[PartyDAO](https://party.mirror.xyz/) is a decentralized collection of developers, writers, engineers, and designers who design and build DAO tools. Their first product, "[PartyBid](https://www.partybid.app/)," allows users to pool funds to bid on NFTs. Users have used PartyBid to pool funds to bid on Cryptopunks, Andrew Yang's NFT, and CrypToadz. With the release of "[Party Splits](https://twitter.com/prtydao/status/1442976879670177796)" at the end of September

, PartyDAO now enables NFT splitting, distributing ownership.

**Mirror**

[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/), founded by Denis Navaroz, is a decentralized publishing network. Through the WRITE token, users can pay WRITE to create their own Mirror domain, where they can publish articles and influence the approval of new members through their voting power.

In no time, Mirror has become the de facto place to publish reflections on Web3 and launch community efforts. For example, "Crypto, Culture, & Society," initiated by Mirror's CTO, used the platform to describe a crypto learning DAO, raising 25 ETH in the process.

**Seed Club**

[Seed Club](https://seedclub.xyz/) is a DAO that builds, supports, and invests in tokenized communities. The community includes many leading influencers and founders in the social token space. Already, Seed Club has worked with leading DAOs and communities, including PartyDAO, Forefront, The Generalist, and SquiggleDAO.

**FWB**

We’ve mentioned FWB before, but the influence of the DAO deserves a bit longer discussion. Just this week, the prominent social DAO announced it had raised $10 million from a16z, Pace, and others.

FWB hosts one of the largest collections of crypto thinkers and facilitates large-scale discussions. One Discord channel might discuss music, another NFTs, while a third riffs on investments. In addition to acting as a kind of social Web3 club, FWB members are actively creating products for the community, as mentioned. In short, it is emerging as a true cultural and generative home for crypto.

**The LAO**

By definition, [The LAO](https://www.thelao.io/) is not _quite_ a DAO. Rather, founder Aaron Wright's entity is a "limited liability autonomous organization." While retaining many traits of a DAO, The LAO is a legally incorporated entity in Delaware. By anchoring the product in the traditional legal world, The LAO seeks to streamline and simplify thorny legal and tax issues for its members.

Beyond its differentiated structure, The LAO stands out for its influence in the Investment DAO space. Not only has it received over $65 million in contributions, but it has spawned a wave of offshoots. This includes [Flamingo](http://flamingodao.xyz) (an NFT collective), [Red DAO](http://reddao.xyz) (a digital fashion DAO), [Neon](http://neondao.xyz) (a metaverse DAO), [Neptune](http://neptunedao.xyz) (a DeFi liquidity DAO), and more. As noted in the diversity of the aforementioned DAOs, limited liability structures can be useful across the spectrum of crypto-related projects.

Given that these entities have been extremely active in crypto over the past two years, the paper returns are almost certainly insane. Wright himself tweeted that Flamingo was on track to have $1 billion in AUM:

**MetaCartel**

[MetaCartel](https://www.metacartel.org/) is a decentralized group of builders that originally worked to support the development of Dapps but has since pivoted to incubating DAOs. MetaCartel educates people about DAOs, conducts case studies on real-world DAOs, and assists in everything related to the development and launching of a new DAO.

MetaCartel has also created an investment branch, called MetaCartel Ventures. It has, in turn, invested in several other DAOs.

**Moloch**

[Moloch DAO](https://www.molochdao.com/) was originally founded to fund the development of public Ethereum infrastructure related to ETH 2.0. Since then, Moloch has evolved into a grants DAO, supporting projects like Tornado Cash, Lodestar, and the Dapp node through its grants. Many sub-guilds have been created to evaluate projects requesting funding.

Additionally, MolochDAO offers an open-source DAO framework with their v2 smart contracts. We noted earlier that Tribute and DAOhaus have benefited from Moloch's work here.

**Rabbithole**

[Rabbithole](https://rabbithole.gg/) is a learn-to-earn DAO, offering consumers a path to learn more about crypto while receiving rewards.

In the process, Rabbithole provides crypto protocols with user acquisition. The number of crypto protocols and products has exploded over the past year, making it difficult for some projects to find and retain active and qualified participants.

Through "quests," Rabbithole helps protocols acquire trained community members who have demonstrated their capability in the process. Aave, Opensea, Matcha, Perpetual Protocol, and PoolTogether have all worked with Rabbithole.

With new DAOs gaining traction every day, expect this list of influential organizations to grow rapidly in the coming months and years.
