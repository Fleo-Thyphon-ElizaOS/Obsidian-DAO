#DAO 
# **Asset Management**

Asset management may be the most crypto-native use case for DAOs, promising the largest allocation of capital. The efficiency gains captured by the low-friction architecture of DeFi translate into relatively high interest rates for stakeholders and investors looking to earn a return on their capital. Once Ethereum transitions to proof of stake at the end of 2021, the network as a whole will become much more economically efficient, no longer needing to finance proof-of-work mining and a hardware arms race. Thus, one could expect its parent yield to improve even further. In fact, staked Ethereum is likely to converge toward a "base rate" in DeFi for the entire crypto economy as marginal revenue approaches marginal cost.

In theory, decisions about fund allocation can be made much more intelligently by a DAO due to the collective intelligence and "wisdom of crowds" that emerge when aggregating the experiences and ideas of multiple independent agents.

Another key point of DAOs from an asset management perspective is their transparency in fund usage. Using a DAO allows all stakeholders to track expenditures and hold the DAO accountable. This is evident in the use of the [Aragon Association's Budget DAO](https://client.aragon.org/#/budget/0xcec16a4046dd2d1dd0b57019609e86d5d49b655d/), which is used for daily transactions to provide visibility into fund usage for all stakeholders.

## **DecentralizeWSB**

Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of [Social Capital](https://www.socialcapital.com/) and chairman of [Virgin Galactic](https://www.virgingalactic.com/), referred to the Reddit group [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) as the "[largest hedge fund in the world](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1355580731980869637)" after members of the group determined that the short interest in [NYSE: GME](https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:GME) was greater than the stock's exceptional float, causing the price to rise from ~$18 to ~$340, forcing professional firms to cover their shorts.

[DecentralizeWSB](https://www.decentralizewsb.com) is an emerging attempt to structure the r/WallStreetBets movement into a DAO where investment strategies can be voted on and executed. So far, about 20,000 signers have expressed interest.

## **PieDAO**

[PieDAO](https://www.piedao.org/) provides cryptocurrency asset management in the form of index trackers and yield-bearing "PieVaults." The composition of the vaults is entirely governed by the decisions of $DOUGH holders, who also earn a portion of the fees generated by the platform. PieDAO also introduces the concept of "meta-governance," where any governance token held in a PieVault will be automatically delegated to PieDAO, giving $DOUGH holders the right to vote on governance decisions of this protocol. This is akin to individual ETF holders being able to vote on its composition as well as on internal decisions regarding its underlying assets.

## **BitDAO**

DAOs are primarily local disruptors, but recent activity shows they can quickly reach Redwood-scale proportions. [BitDAO](https://www.bitdao.io/) recently raised a massive $230 million from investors such as Peter Thiel, Pantera Capital, and Dragonfly Capital. $BitDAO token holders will vote on where to invest the funds, making it one of the largest DAOs in the world in terms of assets under management.
