As the debt-to-asset ratio of some U.S. states exceeds 400%, and civic institutions around the world struggle to cope with limited resources, delegated assemblies and community groups are beginning to take over. This can range from a community cleanup group, neighborhood watch, municipal voting initiative, or even a national system like [EstoniaDAO](https://estoniadao.org). DAOs like this can operate on a one-person-one-vote basis with non-transferable tokens indicating membership, allowing for the onboarding of new residents.

In contrast, in "The Sovereign Individual," Davidson & Rees-Mogg warn that the disappearance of governments is likely to increase the "rewards of violence" in the short term, necessitating community solutions for safety and security. On the positive side, DAOs offer a way to combine the best of individual innovation with collective action where previously, to paraphrase Thomas Piketty, the bipolar confrontations between collectivism and individualism have tended to inhibit progress (to say the least...).

More broadly, DAOs are actually microcosms of political parties with integrated treasuries and directly accountable public services. Signaling platforms like [Aragon Voice](https://voice.aragon.org/) allow decision-makers to avoid harmful political missteps by quickly polling community sentiment efficiently and transparently before significant resources are committed to preparing a subsequent vote.

Unlike legacy politics, DAOs typically focus on a single vertical and seek to acquire expertise in that area, rather than attempting to manage multiple domains. DAOs are also largely meritocratic, globally diverse, and utilize much more sophisticated voting systems. They are the petri dishes of governance that Aragon was founded to encourage. Decades of time and liters of ink have been spent trying to perfect the art of representative assemblies, without much satisfaction. Web3 is a grassroots movement to step back from the ideological rat race and build an entirely new system from the ground up. Remote politics creates apathetic voters, but in DAOs, voters see immediate and tangible results from their engagement. This creates a virtuous cycle; when people see that their voices are heard, they become more motivated to contribute further.

In the language of fund management, there is no greater "alpha" than decentralization. $100 million of committed funds and a multi-year track record of success are the bare minimum to even consider starting a traditional hedge fund. The number of regulatory hoops and licenses required is staggering. Depending on the investment strategy and where your backers and management team are based, you'll need to decide which jurisdiction to incorporate in and will often end up complying with regulations across multiple jurisdictions. In short, the cost of starting a hedge fund with a traditional structure can easily reach six figures. Regulatory authorities can take months to approve applications, and even after all that, over 80% of funds will fail. 

In contrast, DAOs are born freely on open-source software in cyberspace. For this reason, the DAO approach to security has evolved in a radically different way. In 'A Technical Analysis of the Genesis Alpha Hack', Adam Levi wrote, "... our approach to security is fire-tested." Such a claim is incomprehensible for a financial industry governed by the [precautionary principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle), but for a DAO, it makes perfect sense: it is impossible, even for a professionally audited codebase, to be perfectly secure, so it is much cheaper to embrace that reality, treat hackers as unpaid auditors, and mitigate risk through diversification and continuous improvement rather than stifling the entire industry with regulation. This emphasis on personal accountability is incredibly effective in a sector where capital can effortlessly flow between competing projects, and even rumors of a security breach can wipe out a project’s funding in a matter of hours. Furthermore, many opportunities for fraud that regulators attempt to protect against paternalistically in traditional finance are rendered impossible by the transparency of the DAO architecture.

Finally, investment research is incredibly labor-intensive, so by outsourcing it to a swarm of motivated token holders, a DAO is already on a much steeper trajectory toward profitability.

A brief definition is that a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an Internet community that jointly controls a cryptocurrency portfolio to pursue common goals—such as managing a business or a charity—without needing to ask anyone for permission. This is made possible by open-source software on the Ethereum blockchain (among others), which can lock funds in a wallet and only allow transactions if they are voted on by DAO members. To become a member, it generally suffices to purchase a fraction of that DAO's membership token on sites like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) (although more tokens typically mean more weight in the votes you participate in).

The answers to many common questions can be found in our article [How to DAO](https://blog-aragon-org.translate.goog/how-to-dao-answers-for-beginners/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp), but for those of you looking for a broader overview of the DAO phenomenon, it's worth first examining how we humans are currently organizing ourselves.
