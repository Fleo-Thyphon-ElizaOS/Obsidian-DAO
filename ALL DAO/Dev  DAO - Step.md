**No one in 1996, tapping their fingers waiting for a 56k modem, could have imagined voting from an iPhone in a Costa Rican nomad DAO for a flash loan of decentralized currency to a yield farm governed on Discord. Yet, here we are, and this composability will only accelerate as DAOs remove all remaining technological and legal friction between trustless collaborators.**

History proves once again that bureaucracy, with its information deficits and regulations, will always be outpaced by frictionless alternatives. Plumbers have a saying that "water always wins," and DAOs are proving that if anyone tries to control the liquidity of ideas, it will eventually break through.

Bureaucracy and a lack of opportunities kill far too many good ideas, so in this series, we’ll show examples of how regular people, without a Goldman Sachs on their resume or $100 million in funding, have built art houses, media companies, hedge funds, and boards from scratch using Web3 open-source technology. Using Aragon OpenStack, anyone with an internet connection and $0.2 ETH can create a borderless organization with secure treasury, censorship-resistant voting, and a fully transparent audit trail in minutes. This is called a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or "DAO" (read: [How to DAO: Answers for Beginners](https://blog-aragon-org.translate.goog/how-to-dao-answers-for-beginners/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp) for more information).

In this first article, we’ll learn how [Surf.finance](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://www.surf.finance/) built a $5 million hedge fund using little more than a Discord channel and an Aragon DAO.

## Part 1: Build a Community

In 2020, @Proof—the anonymous founder of Surf—was 30 years old, living in the US, and working in the gaming industry. He had been researching cryptocurrency for years, knew friends who made millions building arbitrage bots, but hadn’t yet figured out how to enter crypto full-time.

With a vague idea of harnessing the crowd’s wisdom and the crypto community’s latent talent, he began creating a Discord channel, inviting thoughtful members from other projects to discuss crypto markets and potential investment opportunities. This early talent search quickly formed the core team and an army of dedicated researchers eager to sift through whitepapers and social channels for smart investments.

Accredited investor rules and high capital requirements make fundraising one of the hardest parts of creating a traditional hedge fund. In contrast, crypto opens the door to global capital flows and a huge pool of willing investors. Thus, even at this very early stage, Surf’s Discord channel was already an unofficial hedge fund with about $1 million ready to invest.

## Part 2: Incorporate as an Aragon DAO

As the Discord channel grew, the community needed a way to pool funds trustlessly, vote on potential investments, and execute transactions. They also needed to formalize the organization and ensure transparency regarding fund use. Eventually, two trusted developers from the community suggested using an Aragon DAO as the organization’s administrative layer to store funds, manage votes, and provide transparency to the community.

A DAO can be thought of as a publicly listed company, but instead of shares, DAOs issue their own tokens. Tokens serve multiple functions: most importantly, their price is an indicator of the DAO's value. If the token price rises, potential investors are incentivized to learn about and vet the DAO before investing. If they buy the token, they are then incentivized to contribute their time, energy, and resources to increase the value of their token holdings, thus becoming unpaid employees of the DAO. For Surf, the core team had already created a $SURF token and distributed it in a fair launch, though for most projects, this can be done during the DAO setup process.

**Steps to set up your DAO:**

1. Obtain $ETH. **Note**: You will need at least $0.2 ETH to set up an Aragon DAO.
2. Send your $ETH to your Web3 wallet.
3. Go to [Aragon](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://client.aragon.org/) and connect your Web3 wallet.
4. Click 'Create an Organization.'
5. Select the model you wish to use and click "Use this model."
6. Choose a name for your organization. Click 'Next.'
7. Set your voting thresholds and voting duration. Click 'Next.'
8. Choose a token name and symbol. Add a few wallet addresses to issue the tokens. Click 'Next.'
9. Review the settings and "Launch your organization."
10. Sign the transaction in your Web3 wallet to execute the operation.

Surf launched with a progressive decentralization strategy, meaning the project would become more decentralized over time. For now, the core team builds the project infrastructure and sets its overall direction. Once all critical pieces are in place, protocol ownership will be fully transferred to a DAO controlled by all token holders in the community. Although the protocol is not currently community-controlled, Surf’s products are still non-custodial, meaning only the investor controls their funds.

## Part 3: Decide on Your Strategy

A DAO can employ many strategies to grow and reward its members. Instead of dividends, many DAOs use their profits to buy back the token, pushing up its price. Some DAOs even “burn” tokens by sending them to an unrecoverable address to permanently increase token scarcity and boost everyone’s relative holdings. In Surf’s case, they built a staking pool called "Whirlpool" to earn passive income for token holders.

The Whirlpool is a contract on Ethereum that distributes the revenue and profits made from Surf DAO applications and assets to project participants who have staked $SURF/$ETH Uniswap LP tokens in the Whirlpool contract. The Whirlpool also deters predatory market actors by charging an exit fee governed by the DAO on LP tokens withdrawn from the Whirlpool.

## Part 4: Manage Your Organization

A DAO organizes much of an organization’s administration: it serves as a bank vault and payment rail, token holders become employees, the R&D department, and marketing team, and DAOs are globally unregulated by default, so no armies of lawyers or compliance officers are required.

The Surf team opted for a slightly more hierarchical structure by creating separate $SurfDAO tokens for six community members as a de facto board, able to plan and approve transactions to maximize the $SURF token’s value. These six members were well-known, trusted developers from other projects. Four out of six votes are required to approve a transaction, or three with a 24-hour delay.

At this point, Surf’s Discord and Telegram groups had 3,000 members, and the core team was fully comprised of talented community members who love the project and align with its vision of making passive income accessible to everyone. @Proof was able to make the leap to full-time work thanks to returns from his stake in Surf’s Whirlpool fund, now central to Surf’s investment ecosystem.

Day-to-day, the community proposes and discusses potential investments throughout the week on Discord and Telegram. Once there’s a general consensus, the transaction is planned and voted on by $SurfDAO token holders. It’s inevitable that some community members will disagree with an investment decision or partnership, but it’s up to the community to determine how much weight to give dissenting voices, keeping in mind that all token holders’ incentives are aligned.

In addition, the core team holds a weekly voice call to align on overall strategy and discuss any community issues.

## Part 5: Grow Your Organization

So far, the team has executed 30 votes to invest over $1 million in projects such as [amplify.art](http://amplify.art), [cyberkongz.com](https://cyberkongz.com), and [y.at](http://y.at/). The fund has grown to hold approximately $2 million in assets, and investors have provided over $3 million in liquidity for the $SURF token on the decentralized exchange Uniswap. Liquidity providers have seen returns of over 130% since Surf launched last year. The Surf team continues to create innovative passive income products such as [polywave.finance](https://polywave.finance) on Polygon, which supports the core fund on Ethereum, and now includes over 10 developers working on different aspects of the ecosystem.

## Part 6: Hedge Funds vs DAO Funds

In the fund management world, there’s no greater “alpha” than decentralization. $100 million in committed funds and a multi-year success record are the bare minimum to consider creating a traditional hedge fund. The regulatory hoops and licenses required are formidable. Depending on your investment strategy and where your investors and management team are based, you must decide which jurisdiction to incorporate in and will often need to comply with regulations across multiple jurisdictions. In short, setting up a hedge fund with a traditional structure can easily cost six figures. Regulators can take months to approve applications, and even then, more than 80% of funds fail.

By contrast, DAOs are born free on open-source software in cyberspace. For this reason, the DAO approach to security has evolved in a radically different way. In "A Technical Analysis of the Genesis Alpha Hack," Adam Levi wrote, "...our approach to security is trial by fire." Such a statement would be inconceivable for a precautionary principle–driven financial industry, but for a DAO, it makes perfect sense: it’s impossible, even for a

 professionally audited codebase, to be perfectly secure, so it’s much cheaper to embrace this reality, treat hackers as unpaid auditors, and cushion the risk through diversification and continuous improvement rather than stifling the entire industry with regulation.

Investment research is incredibly labor-intensive, so outsourcing it to a swarm of motivated token holders already puts a DAO on a much steeper path to profitability.
