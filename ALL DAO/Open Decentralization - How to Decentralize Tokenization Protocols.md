### **Open Decentralization: How to Decentralize Tokenization Protocols**

Tokenization protocols are another type of emerging Web3 system. In these systems, assets are integrated into a blockchain, symbolized by a smart contract protocol, and then sold or used for other purposes. Types of tokenization protocols include series NFT minting projects, digital asset marketplaces, and protocols that tokenize real-world assets.

The open decentralization model below reflects:

- **Assets** brought on-chain by multiple providers through a shared smart contract protocol;
- The **smart contract protocol** tokenizing these assets;
- The sale or use of these **symbolized assets** through multiple clients;
- **Native digital asset distributions** and incentive mechanisms; and
- The launch of **DAO governance** regarding community intellectual property and the DAO treasury.

In this model, economic decentralization is achieved through sufficient diversity of inputs (asset providers) and outputs (asset acquirers), as well as the decentralization of the layers through which tokenized assets circulate (the blockchain, smart contracts, and clients).

The protocol's DAO could also use **explicit incentives** (fungible symbolic rewards, no commissions/fees, etc.) to:

- Incentivize asset providers to supply assets to the system;
- Incentivize clients to create a marketplace for the symbolized assets; and
- Incentivize acquirers to purchase or consume these assets.

While the initial development company may initially play a significant role in one of these roles (asset provider, client operator, asset acquirer), once the system is decentralized, the development company would ultimately be just one of many actors in a given role. This would limit the risk of significant information asymmetries and reduce reliance on its management efforts. Additionally, many roles could be assumed by the DAO and/or sub-DAOs.

Over time, explicit incentives could also be adjusted to account for potential shortages on the supply or demand side. In a decentralized market, for example, symbolic incentives for sellers (supply side) could be increased to bring more goods to sell on the platform; and symbolic incentives for buyers (demand side) could be increased to encourage more purchases.

From a legal decentralization perspective, the key questions would again be: Are essential managerial efforts from any third party necessary to ensure the success or failure of the Web3 system? And is there a risk of significant information asymmetries arising? The answer to both questions would depend on the DAO's ability to effectively manage its incentives to balance supply and demand, as in the example above—but more generally, it’s really about preventing a single asset provider, asset acquirer, or client from becoming so important that the entire system's success relies on one entity's efforts.
