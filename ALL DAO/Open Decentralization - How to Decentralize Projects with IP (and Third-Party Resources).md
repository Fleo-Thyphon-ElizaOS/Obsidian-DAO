### **Open Decentralization: How to Decentralize Projects with IP (and Third-Party Resources)**

An iteration of the open decentralized model worth further exploration is one where a third party brings a resource into the web3 system, intending for clients within the system to use it for their products and services.

This could take the form of intellectual property (IP) licensing (such as a game engine, data asset, marketplace, etc.), as well as an array of services (including regulatory compliance, marketing, and business development) that anyone in the ecosystem could use or incorporate into their own client. The model below reflects IP brought into the web3 system:

The introduction of proprietary IP might _appear_ to revert part of the system's decentralized economy back to a Web2-style, owner-controlled economy, especially if the developers/operators of clients are unwilling to subject their products and services to the whims and control of the IP owner.

However, this _risk could be mitigated by the contractual terms of the license_ (such as irrevocable/perpetual duration, rights to modify/improve, etc.). An important consideration here would be what ongoing services and IP maintenance are needed, and whether these services and maintenance (if any) could be provided by independent third parties—because a heavy reliance on a single third-party IP owner _could undermine the overall economic decentralization of the system._

Ultimately, if the terms of the web3 system were properly structured, its decentralized economy would remain intact. For example, a web3 system using a widely available API (Application Programming Interface) within its clients would likely not compromise the overall decentralization of the web3 system but might actually enhance it.

From a legal decentralization perspective, key questions to consider are: Are essential managerial efforts from the IP provider necessary to drive the success or failure of the web3 system? Would there be a risk of significant information asymmetries? Even if the IP were crucial to the system’s success, if the IP owner could not revoke it at any time, then the answer to both questions might be no—thus supporting the system’s legal decentralization. This would also be true if the IP owners were required to seek DAO approval before making critical changes to the IP.

This concept can extend beyond intellectual property to other resources that could also be provided or licensed to a web3 system. For example, if a third-party regulatory compliance service allowed DeFi protocols to confirm that their users were verified U.S. persons, such a service should not compromise the decentralization of the web3 system. Similarly, one could imagine third parties providing marketing and business development services to the protocol—_independently of the activities of individual client companies._

While introducing third-party resources may detract from system decentralization in various ways, these risks (as above) can generally be mitigated through structural and contractual mechanisms.
