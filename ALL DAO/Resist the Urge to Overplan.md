When I spoke with him, I had 100 questions about legal structures, tokenomics, treasury management, etc. His calm and obvious advice in hindsight was to wait to answer questions about formal governance structures until they were necessary. And, more importantly, to let the community itself help inform its answers.

Starting a DAO is an exercise in self-restraint. The sexy part of starting a DAO is thinking about tokenomics and governance structures. It’s really fun to dive down a rabbit hole and spend 8 hours on a whiteboard designing the perfect architecture for every process or need that might arise.

But the crucial part of starting a DAO is community building. Every hour you spend designing governance from the outset—before there’s even anything to govern!—is an hour wasted. Instead, the best approach is to build the initial skeleton and spend most of your time building the community.

Ultimately, the community will decide what is needed and when. They may even modify the initial skeleton set by the founding team. And that’s okay! There’s a leap of faith required to trust the community as contributors, but once you do, you will feel liberated. I promise.
