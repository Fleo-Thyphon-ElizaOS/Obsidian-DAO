**Investment DAO: A New Way to Achieve High Returns**

Imagine a way to collaborate and invest with others worldwide without knowing who they are, steering a project together toward a common goal, and making huge profits without a central authority arbitrating decisions. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) make this a reality.

A DAO is an entity without a central authority governing its organization. Members of the organization, no matter how many, hold control. The rules and governance processes governing DAOs, to which members must adhere, are fully transparent and coded into the governance contract. Since these rules and processes are "set in stone" (or defined in code), no manager is required, reducing bureaucracy and hierarchical barriers.

For a DAO to be fully functional, there are three prerequisites:

1. A coded set of rules/processes by which it will operate.
2. A token, to determine voting rights and reward DAO activities completed by members.
3. A purpose (the project must have a "reason for being," a problem it solves, or a goal).

DAO activities generally include:

- Making proposals, for example, development proposals related to the project/organization.
- Making decisions on proposals, yes or no.

The goal is for members to steer the project into the future and make necessary developments to support the project’s goal/growth. Typically, members receive voting rights proportional to the number of tokens they own, but DAO rules may choose otherwise. This works somewhat like a democracy, except that some members may have more voting rights than others. A well-designed DAO governance process is important to ensure members participate, propose ideas, and decide the right course for the project/organization.

There are several use cases DAOs can address. DAOs have been developed for various applications, including but not limited to investment and asset management, charity, fundraising, and the decentralization of any layer-1 blockchain project or layer-2 dApps—all without a central authority. For example, in a charity DAO, the organization receives donations from around the world, and its members decide via the DAO how those donations are administered. Let’s take a closer look at investment DAOs.

### Investment DAO Utility

An investment DAO, in its simplest form, pools members' assets in a single account and sets up a DAO so members can decide together how those assets are invested and how the proceeds are distributed.

In 2022, we’re seeing a significant number of investment DAOs emerge. Perhaps this will be the year of DAO frenzy, similar to what we saw with DeFi and NFTs.

Regardless of composition, investment DAOs generally follow a similar investment process:

1. Pool members' assets into a single pot.
2. Projects are proposed for investment.
3. Members vote "Go" or "No-Go" to invest in a project.
4. If "Go," the DAO invests in the approved project on behalf of the organization (usually automated).
5. Members vote on when to divest (sell) a project.
6. Members vote on how the profits from an investment are distributed (e.g., dividends to members, reinvestment in new projects, donations to charities, etc.).

Investment DAOs generally have an address where all assets are stored, often requiring multi-signatures to authorize transactions and enable smooth capital allocation. An investment DAO’s strategy is very important—some may focus on early-stage crypto projects, others may invest only in NFTs, or even real-world assets like real estate. Recently, many DAOs have focused on Web3.0 startups or play-to-earn projects.

Investment DAOs contrast sharply with traditional financial organizations, which can be hierarchical, elitist, localized, and opaque. Investment decisions are made by a small number of people, known as the investment office. In contrast, DAOs consist of grassroots networks with anywhere from a few people to thousands of members, and investment decisions are made by all members.

As a result, DAOs can attract investors globally while offering greater flexibility in terms of investment size and type. Additionally, unlike traditional organizations, they offer a social bond that unites all members and displays radical transparency through smart contract executions. With this in mind, here are two examples of investment DAOs offering exciting investment opportunities.

### The Rebellion Protocol

The Rebellion Protocol is a venture capital (VC) fund focused on cryptocurrency, managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Its slogan: “You don’t need a suit to run Wall Street.”

The project aims to bring together experienced individuals to manage an investment fund more profitable and enjoyable than any traditional VC firm.

The Rebellion Protocol DAO (REBL DAO) is designed for the community to make decisions about the project ecosystem, including investment decisions and changes to the project contract itself. Additionally, its processes are designed to secure the best possible financial returns for crypto investors. Finally, the project’s simple architecture makes it highly accessible to anyone globally. As such, anyone can buy the project’s token ($REBL) and become a venture capitalist.

Traditional investment funds exclusively attract institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, making this asset class accessible only to the top one percent globally. By contrast, Rebellion Protocol aims to democratize crypto VC investments, which typically yield returns of 10-100x (1,000% to 10,000%) annually, and make them accessible to everyone, anywhere in the world.

### The $REBL Token

The Rebellion Protocol token ($REBL) is a BEP-20 token that can be purchased on PancakeSwap (a decentralized exchange). Total transaction fees of 9% are levied and divided into three parts:

- Funding the VC fund
- Redistributing a constant reward to token holders
- Enhancing liquidity

This means that, unlike traditional VCs that need to raise funds and are illiquid, Rebellion Protocol grows its VC fund with the number of investors (no fundraising) and investors can buy/sell at any time since liquidity is available 24/7.

### The REBL DAO NFT (DAO Token)

The Rebellion Protocol NFT collection is designed with the community in mind. As such, REBL DAO NFTs provide voting rights to holders, used in the REBL DAO to make investment decisions and determine future project developments. REBL DAO NFTs are distributed to members who stake their $REBL. In the future, a marketplace will be available to buy/sell REBL DAO NFTs.

### Governance

As noted, REBL DAO NFT holders have voting rights. These rights can be used to elect investment advisors tasked with proposing investments to be approved by the community (REBL DAO NFT holders). There are two types of governance processes on the platform.

**General governance processes** involve all non-investment decisions, including voting on changes to transaction fees, anti-whale protection mechanisms, electing or rejecting investment consultants, and voting on how the community reserve should be managed.

**Investment governance processes**, on the other hand, involve voting on investment-related decisions. Typically, voting on investment proposals, voting on how investment profits should be redistributed, voting on token burns, and changes related to paying dividends to investors.
