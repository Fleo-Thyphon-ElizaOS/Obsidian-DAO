## The Life of a Protocol Politician

Itâ€™s Monday morning. 9 AM. Time to get to work.

While others are commuting and getting stuck in traffic, you open your laptop, and boom, youâ€™re off to the races. You check Twitter, Discord, and Reddit to keep up with the latest discussions.

Yes, this form of work is a bit unconventional. It requires specialized knowledge and the ability to inspire changeâ€”the life of aÂ _protocol politician_Â is based on sovereignty.

As we haveÂ [coveredÂ endlessly](http://podcast.banklesshq.com/comp-growth-hacking-defi-dan-elitzer)Â in recent weeks, yield farming is all the rage. And while itâ€™s easy to see liquidity mining as a way to make a profit, the premise underpinning these systems is where the real value lies.

Governanceâ€”or the ability to participate in discussions about the protocols shaping the future of the most popular crypto productsâ€”is the main event here.

For the vast majority of DeFi protocols, yield farming is done to earn native governance tokens. Whether itâ€™s Compound, Balancer, Curve, or dozens of other protocols that will soon follow, theseÂ **tokens are a means of influence**.

The best part? Power can be gained by anyone in the world with an internet connection. All they have to do is demonstrate tangible value.

Just like with legacy governance systems, the framework of digital legislation looks similar.

Discussions evolve into working documents that turn into votes. The advantage of DeFi governance over traditional systems is that voting takes place entirely on-chain. Itâ€™s completely transparent, and anyone can verify how their legislators are voting.

Now, with the ability to delegate power with just a few clicks from anywhere in the world, we are no longer competing as nations, but rather as a borderless ecosystem.

### **What is a Protocol Politician?**

Protocol politicians are someone (or a group of people) who:

- Oversee governance across specific protocols in which they are well-versed.
- Regularly participate in governance to drive positive change through new proposals.
- Are willing to vote publicly on controversial issues and back their votes with rational arguments.

This last point, in particular, deserves elaboration. Just as we see Dharma playing a huge role in Compound governance, it is likely that these systems will be driven by key players in these protocols.

### **Whatâ€™s in it for Politicians?**

Influence has value. And people are also willing to pay for it, especially as protocols facilitate the flow of increasing capital. Drawing a parallel with todayâ€™s politics,Â [U.S. congressionalÂ campaignsÂ areÂ raisingÂ recordÂ amounts](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-money-parties/heated-u-s-congressional-races-on-pace-to-break-fundraising-records-idUSKCN1MQ2Z9). House candidates collectively raised about $1.2 billion in January 2017, which is over $200 million more than the ~ $1 billion adjusted for inflation set during the 2010 election cycle.

Equally important, there areÂ **only a limited number of seats at the table.**Â With 3.7 million COMP in circulation, thereâ€™s only room for about 37 possible delegates (100,000 COMP per delegate). Fully diluted, thereâ€™s an absolute maximum of 100 Compound delegates able to propose changes to the protocol. Eventually, individuals and businesses will start bidding for these spots.

Although itâ€™s still early, we suspect that the ability of protocol politicians to earn fees will also create attractive revenue streams. Highlighted by KyberDAO and the ability for Pool Masters (a.k.a. protocol politicians) to earn a share of delegated rewards, we expect that there will be individuals and companies capable of generating sustainable income entirely from governance.

Currently, Kyber is expected to generateÂ [3.4 millionÂ dollarsÂ inÂ annualizedÂ revenue](https://www.tokenterminal.xyz/). The next update of Katalyst should allocate 65% of protocol revenue to governance incentives, amounting to $2.21 million to be earned by participants. Whatâ€™s interesting about Kyber is that governance rewards will be in ETH. Delegates will be able to earn a share of these rewards regardless of the fee structure they have set, while delegates can opt-in and out at any time.

We can imagine that as Kyber continues to grow (as it hasÂ [done](https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-ecosystem-report-15-f5c7dca5d713)), the potential revenues for protocol politicians will only become more lucrative.

Compound is another example. At todayâ€™s COMP valuations, the lending protocol currently relies on a treasury of about $166 million fully allocated to governance incentives. Even if it slowly drips over the next decade to about $16.6 million per year, itâ€™s still a huge treasury, even at todayâ€™s prices.

As we see with Dharma's active participation in Compound today, teams can even begin to allocate resources to focus specifically on governance of the protocols in which they are invested.

Whether it arises from upgrades that best suit their product or simply having an informed voice in the evolution of the protocol,Â _with great composability comes great responsibility_. Itâ€™s important that people do things right.

We can also consider what a protocol politician looks like without financial incentives in mind. While nearly 99% of protocol politicians will be motivated to increase the value of the underlying assets or fees paid to them for their participation, we can envision a "Gandhi" governance that holds no tokens, extracts no rent, but has tons of voting weight. The politician is simply there for the greater good and long-term growth of the underlying protocol.

As more and more protocols symbolize their governance, those who have been involved early are likely to be rewarded for doing so. Better yet, value-added work can be recognized in various ways, meaning that even those without vast sums of capital can gain influence in governance.

With Maker, Aave, Kyber, Nexus Mutual, UMA, bZx, and others all ready to deploy updated governance frameworks,Â **the time has come to delegate.**

### **Whatâ€™s in it for Delegators?**

With so much governance discussion happening regularly, itâ€™s important to ensure that your voting rights are used for every proposal. Rather than having to dive deep to vote one way or another, trusted protocol politicians can play that role for you.

We expect that protocol politicians will offer services in exchange for your delegation, including synthesized summaries to keep you informed about key changes without having to be deeply knowledgeable about the weeds of how they got there.

We may even see whatÂ [JamesÂ Waugh](https://twitter.com/BlockchainJames)Â callsÂ [ProposalÂ Farmers](https://medium.com/axialabs/move-over-yield-farming-proposal-farming-has-arrived-d4942fd91c2)â€”that is, protocol politicians competing to craft the most impactful and widely accepted governance proposals. These proposals may be directly tied to symbolic incentives (that protocol politicians could share with their delegators) in addition to acting as a delegation signal.

Most importantly, delegating to a good protocol politician can be quite lucrative. Beyond the appropriate protocol upgrades that you benefit from as a token holder, there may also be residual benefits, just as we see withÂ [Kyberâ€™scommunityÂ poll](https://defirate.com/kyber-community-pool/)Â and the possibility to earn ETH rewards with minimal work or knowledge.

### **Key Protocol Politicians Today**

So far, weâ€™ve seen the usual suspects step up to take advantage of being an early protocol politician. While we havenâ€™t yet seen delegation really take off, we fully suspect teams to allocate significant marketing resources to aggregate as much voting weight as possible, especially as revenue opportunities become more attractive.

In particular, some emerging protocol politicians include:

- **Media:**Â [DeFiÂ Rate](https://compound.finance/governance/address/0xcfae402f6ced5a476554235b5026c005c85c135a)Â andÂ [Bankless](https://compound.finance/governance/address/0xfdaae0c5a7a56c8265b9f86cf8cd934a494e3733)Â (ðŸ‘ˆÂ _RSAâ€”we have big plans here!_)
    
- **Consultants:**Â [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/gauntletnetwork/status/1276969244979331072?s=20)
    
- **Apps:**Â [Dharma](https://compound.finance/governance/address/0x7e4a8391c728fed9069b2962699ab416628b19fa),Â [PoolTogether](https://compound.finance/governance/address/0x98ea2d8438f70ce876c2db26fc494cfed10b4cd7), andÂ [InstaDapp](https://compound.finance/governance/address/0x1d29756e8f7b091ce6c11a35980de79c7eda5d1f)
    
- **Opinion Leaders:**Â [KainÂ Warwick](https://twitter.com/kaiynne)Â andÂ [RicÂ Burton](https://compound.finance/governance/address/0xbbd13ca6aace2a8eccbde88bc7849c3c6e4e172e)
    
- **Venture Capital Funds:**Â [a16z](https://compound.finance/governance/address/0xf25f26a42adcb153b1966a4bf5df6d0c9e27197f),Â [Polychain](https://compound.finance/governance/address/0xed409c9ff60f3020abf9012bcd45fc294f5608ff), andÂ [IDEOÂ CoLab](https://twitter.com/IDEOVC/status/1276179184390295552?s=20)
    

Keep a close eye on these folks, as we expect them to make big pushes for governance incentives over the coming year.

### **A Distributed Future**

Letâ€™s imagine these ideas come to fruition. What we could very well envision are autonomous protocols owned and operated by their community. Rather than all the value accruing to a very small number of people, itâ€™s shared proportionately among all players in the ecosystem.

And there is much to gain for those who choose to dive deep into protocols and acquire specialized knowledge. Potentially billions.

There will eventually be a demand for well-thought-out, informed, and qualified individuals for protocol governance. A demand for those who can drive these DeFi protocols to thrive in an open financial infrastructure that will ultimately support billions, if not trillions, of capital.

If one thing is certain, we need the tools to help us get there. From governance aggregation to voting and delegation via chat, we need to empower the average individual not only to allocate their voting power but also to see how their voting power is being used.

Most importantly,Â **we need to show that governance matters**. Whether itâ€™s implementing new features to grow the protocol, updating value accumulation mechanisms, or banding together to fight centralized actors with 10 times more capital, the story of yield farming must emphasize what distributed governance enables.

Until then, be sure to do your own honest work. Stay informed and keep harvesting those governance crops!
