**Liquid Democracy**

Liquid democracy is a form of delegative democracy in which an electorate engages in collective decision-making through direct participation and dynamic representation. Voters can participate directly in all issues or choose to delegate their votes to a representative. Any individual can delegate votes, including representatives in what is called meta-delegation.

Charles Dodgson (known by the pseudonym Lewis Carroll), the author of Alice in Wonderland, first proposed a liquid voting model in *The Principles of Parliamentary Representation* in 1884. In this pamphlet, he envisioned a system where each voter could either vote themselves or transfer their vote to another.

According to Bryan Ford in his article *[Delegative Democracy](https://bford.info/deleg/deleg.pdf)*, liquid democracy is based on the following principles:

- **Role Choice:** Each member can choose to play either a passive role as an *individual* or an active role as a *delegate*. Delegates have other choices regarding *their degree of activity* and in which areas.

- **Low Barrier to Participation:** The difficulty and cost to become a delegate are low and, in particular, do not require campaigning or winning a competitive election.

- **Delegated Authority:** Delegates exercise power in organizational processes in their own name and on behalf of those who vote for them. Different delegates exercise different levels of decision-making power.

- **Privacy of Individuals:** To avoid social pressures or coercion, all votes cast by individuals are private, both from other individuals and from delegates.

- **Accountability of Delegates:** To ensure accountability of delegates to their voters and the community as a whole, all formal deliberative decisions made by delegates are public.

- **Specialization through Redelagation:** Delegates can not only act directly on behalf of individuals as generalists but, through *redelagation*, they can also act on behalf of other specialists.

Key considerations when operating within a liquid democracy framework include:

1. **Meritocracy:** The delegation of votes in a liquid democracy tends to shift toward specialists who have the necessary experience or knowledge. A study by Caragiannis and Evi Micha found that in cases where less-informed citizens delegated to specialists, there was less discovery of "ground truth" – instead, if each voter had voted directly (or if all votes were delegated to a supreme leader), the "ground truth" is more likely to be found.

2. **Oligarchic Tendencies:** Similar to electoral political systems, liquid democracy could lead to a concentration of power in the hands of socially significant, wealthy, and/or politically strategic individuals, resulting in inequality in voting power.

3. **Scale:** As the electorate increases, the number of delegates also increases. Deliberation collapses at a certain point, necessitating fragmentation into groups.

Gitcoin has successfully implemented liquid democracy at the launch of the DAO by asking token holders to select a delegate as part of the airdrop application process.

### Liquid Democracy

Liquid democracy is a system where individuals have the option to vote directly on issues or delegate their vote to someone else, with the ability to retract the delegation at any time. In the United States, we do not have liquid democracy because we cannot directly vote on many bills (our representatives do that for us), and once we elect a representative, they typically remain in office for four years.

This concept seems to be used in proof-of-stake blockchains due to its simplicity.

### Quadratic Voting

Quadratic voting is a system of vote buying where each additional vote costs twice as much as the previous one. In other words, money buys votes, but with diminishing returns. Vitalik proposed a variant called "quadratic voting with coin lock" where N coins allow for N * k votes by locking those coins for a time period of k². This is a nice modification as it aligns incentives over time: more voting power requires living with your decisions longer. In a tokenized world with low friction for entering or exiting a community, this is particularly important.

### Voting with People or Money?

A major issue with the one person = one vote systems on blockchain is their sensitivity to Sybil attacks. The near-zero cost to create infinite accounts means it’s easy to generate infinite votes. That’s why the default model of proof of stake and Ethereum-based token governance is one token = one vote.

Blockchain-based identity systems like Civic can help enable one person = one vote systems. However, anonymity is likely to be preserved in most cryptocurrencies. Identity gives each coin its own unique history, which can be subjectively judged as more or less clean than another coin, leading to a degradation of fungibility. One potential approach is a balance between identity and money: a fully verified identity gets 100% of the voting power of its money, a partially verified identity gets 50%, and a fully anonymous identity gets 25%.

As mentioned in quadratic voting, other mechanisms that weigh community members differently regardless of real-world identity are likely to evolve. For example, a new token holder may have reduced voting power until they have been a community member for a certain period, similar to not being able to vote until you are a full citizen of a country.

In any case, today’s world would be very different if modern governments voted with money, so this change in defaults should not be taken lightly.

Finally, reputation within a symbolic community will be essential. This is already seen indirectly, where Vitalik's suggestions carry significant weight within the Ethereum community. In a liquid democracy system, reputation manifests in the number of votes delegated to a particular person. Someone with a strong reputation and no money could have 10 million Ether delegated to them and hold enormous governance power.

### Other Tools

Simple off-chain futures markets have already proven to be a powerful tool. In the recently proposed and controversial Bitcoin SegWit2x fork, futures markets speculated on the expected value of SegWit2x chains compared to non-SegWit2x chains. Markets systematically valued a SegWit2x chain at less than 20% of a non-SegWit2x chain for three weeks. Supporters of SegWit2x then canceled their fork efforts because they felt they had "not built sufficient consensus." While it’s difficult to know exactly what led them to this conclusion, it seems that futures markets were a strong indicator of the lack of support.
