## DeGov is Necessary

Since the [Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence) in 1996, there has been a key unresolved contradiction in what can be called the cypherpunk ideology. On one hand, cypherpunk values consist of using cryptography to minimize coercion and maximize the efficiency and reach of the primary non-coercive coordination mechanism available at the time: private property and markets. On the other hand, the economic logic of private property and markets is optimized for [“decomposable”](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html#private-goods-private-markets) activities in repeated one-to-one interactions, while the infosphere, where art, documentation, science, and code are produced and consumed through irreducibly one-to-many interactions, is the exact opposite of that.

Two key inherent problems in such an environment need to be addressed:

- **Funding Public Goods**: How can projects that are valuable to a broad and non-selective group of people in the community—yet often have no business model (e.g., layer 1 and layer 2 protocol research, client development, documentation, etc.)—be funded?
- **Maintenance and Upgrades of the Protocol**: How do upgrades to the protocol, as well as regular maintenance and adjustment operations on parts of the protocol that are not stable long-term (e.g., lists of safe assets, price oracle sources, multiparty computation key holders), get agreed upon?

The early blockchain projects largely ignored these two challenges, claiming that the only public good that mattered was network security, which could be achieved with a single algorithm engraved forever and paid for with fixed proof-of-work rewards. This funding status quo was initially possible due to the extreme price surges of Bitcoin from 2010 to 2013, followed by the one-time ICO boom from 2014 to 2017, and again by the simultaneous second crypto bubble from 2014 to 2017, all of which made the ecosystem rich enough to temporarily mask the large market inefficiencies. The long-term governance of public resources was also ignored: Bitcoin took the path of extreme minimization, focusing on providing a fixed-supply currency and ensuring support for layer 2 payment systems like Lightning and nothing else, with a major exception due to the strong [legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) of its pre-existing roadmap (essentially: “proof of stake and sharing”), while sophisticated application layer projects that required something more did not yet exist.

But now, increasingly, this opportunity is dwindling, and the challenges of coordinating protocol maintenance and upgrades, and funding documentation, research, and development while avoiding centralization risks, are at the forefront.

### The Need for DeGov to Fund Public Goods

It’s worth taking a step back and seeing the absurdity of the current situation. The daily mining issuance rewards of Ethereum are about 13,500 ETH, or about $40 million [per day](https://etherscan.io/chart/blockreward). [Transaction fees](https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee) are just as high; the [non-EIP-1559 burned portion](https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee) continues to be about 1,500 ETH (~$4.5 million) per day. Thus, several billion dollars a year are devoted to funding network security. Now, what is the budget of the Ethereum Foundation? About $30 to $60 million per year. There are non-EF players (e.g., Consensys) that contribute to development, but they aren’t much larger. The situation for Bitcoin is similar, with perhaps even less funding for public goods unrelated to security.

Here’s the situation in a graphic:

Within the Ethereum ecosystem, one could argue that this disparity doesn’t matter too much; tens of millions of dollars a year are sufficient to do the necessary R&D, and adding more funds [does not necessarily improve things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month), and thus the risks to the [credible neutrality](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/) of the platform of instituting developer funding in the protocol outweigh the benefits. But in many smaller ecosystems, both within Ethereum and entirely separate blockchains like BCH and Zcash, the same debate is brewing, and at these smaller scales, the imbalance makes a big difference.

Enter DAOs. A project that launches as a "pure" DAO from day one can achieve a combination of two properties that were previously impossible to combine: (i) sufficiency of developer funding, and (ii) credible neutrality of funding (the much-coveted "fair launch"). Instead of developer funding coming from a hardcoded list of recipient addresses, decisions can be made by the DAO itself.

Of course, it is difficult to make a launch perfectly equitable, and the injustice of information asymmetry can often be worse than the injustice of explicit pre-mines (was Bitcoin really a fair launch given how few people had the chance to hear about it at the time 1/4 of the supply had already been distributed by the end of 2010?). But still, compensation in the protocol for public goods unrelated to security from day one seems like a potentially significant step toward achieving sufficient and more neutral funding for developers.

### The Need for DeGov for Protocol Maintenance and Upgrades

Aside from funding public goods, the other equally important issue needing governance is protocol maintenance and upgrades. While I advocate for trying to minimize all non-automated parameter adjustments (see the [“limited governance” section below](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html#solution-1-limited-governance)) and I’m a fan of the [RAI’s “non-governance” strategy](https://docs.reflexer.finance/ungovernance/governance-minimization-guide), there are times when governance is unavoidable. Price oracle inputs need to come from somewhere, and sometimes that place needs to change. Until a protocol "solidifies" into its final form, upgrades need to be coordinated in some manner. Sometimes a protocol’s community might _think_ they are ready to ossify, but then the world throws a curveball requiring a complete and contentious restructuring. What happens if the US dollar collapses and RAI has to scramble to create and maintain its own decentralized CPI index to keep its stablecoin stable and relevant? Here too, DeGov is needed, and thus avoiding it altogether is not a viable solution.

An important distinction is whether _off-chain governance is possible or not_. I have long been an advocate of off-chain governance where possible. And indeed, for base layer blockchains, off-chain governance is entirely _possible_. **But for application layer projects, and especially DeFi projects, we encounter the issue that application layer smart contract systems** _**often directly control external assets**_, and that control cannot be removed. If Tezos’s on-chain governance is captured by an attacker, the community can walk away without any loss beyond the coordination costs (admittedly high). If MakerDAO’s on-chain governance is captured by an attacker, the community can certainly create a new MakerDAO, but they will lose all the ETH and other assets locked in existing MakerDAO CDPs. **Therefore, while off-chain governance is a good solution for base layers and** _**some**_ **application layer projects, many application layer projects, especially DeFi, will inevitably require formalized on-chain governance in one form or another.**
