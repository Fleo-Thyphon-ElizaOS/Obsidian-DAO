One final aspect to address is that governance protocols often rely on rewards to incentivize users to vote. This method is likely employed since decentralized governance is a relatively recent concept that has not yet become mainstream. Protocols offer incentives that can take several forms:

- **Rewards for providing liquidity and promoting the protocol**, as seen with the liquidity mining of Aave or Compound during DeFi Summer. This distribution of tokens serves to thank users for utilizing the protocols but also to distribute these tokens to a wider audience, ensuring maximum decentralization.

- **Grants as rewards**: for those who create and add value to the protocols. A person making a proposal aimed at significant improvement and taking the effort to write the proposal and code it could receive governance token rewards from the protocol in exchange for their involvement. Grants encourage creation, building, and maintaining a protocol that thrives and progresses rapidly.

- **Rewards for protocol security**: take the example of Aave's Safety Module, where users can stake their AAVE governance tokens, thereby protecting the protocol in case of a severe issue. These users make their governance tokens available to the protocol in exchange for rewards, but they also bear the risk for other users. They could potentially lose up to 30% of their tokens to protect users from a specific problem that might occur within the protocol.
