### **Progressive Decentralization**

[Jesse Walden](https://twitter.com/jessewldn) is the person I often turn to when trying to understand Web3 and the [ownership economy](https://variant.fund/the-ownership-economy-crypto-and-consumer-software/). So, when I posed a perplexing question to Patrick Rivera of Mirror: “How can you hope to design great products in a committee?”—he unsurprisingly directed me to Walden's article on progressive decentralization.

Walden wrote that it doesn't make sense to try to design products in a committee or to give tokens from day one. Instead, Walden outlined a framework for approaching decentralization as a three-step process with “the goal of building a sustainable, compliant, and community-owned product”:

**1. Product-Market Fit**

The early days of a crypto startup should resemble the early days of any startup: a small focused team devoting all its energy to building, learning, and iterating until it finds its product-market fit. If your product is bad, a community won’t back it and will disengage regardless of token ownership. Look at how much time VCs spend with their winners compared to their losers.

Web3 startups actually have an advantage here—because of the open nature of Web3, they can rapidly create and test by combining existing smart contracts, code, and products into new ones. DeFi is called “[Money Legos](https://medium.com/totle/building-with-money-legos-ab63a58ae764)” for a reason; every time someone builds something new, it becomes a building block that others can use. **The magic often comes from how teams combine existing Legos, rather than from creating new ones.**

“At this stage,” according to Walden, “**there should be no pretense of decentralization**—a central team drives all product decisions by necessity, in the interest of finding product/market fit.”

This was a breakthrough for me in how I think about Web3 companies: I had lumped all crypto startups into a group I later learned was called "Decentralization Maximalists," but in reality, it’s a very small subset, and the best crypto startups are more pragmatic than that.

So what types of creations might be funded by protocols and built by DAO creators?

- The most obvious is “identity art” that the protocol community can appreciate and share. A DAO artist might create an entire world of NFTs, tens of thousands of unique items to award to token holders, perhaps based on the size of their bag, their history, and their contributions to the community. As we enter the metaverse, these NFTs could evolve into branded protocol clothing or vehicles, the meta-equivalent of T-shirts and bumper stickers. (Hey, not all cultures are intellectual.)

- Another valuable project would be a definitive reference document on blockchain projects, a so-called "Cryptologica Encyclopedia." There is practically no quality information carefully vetted on most projects, tokens, concepts—and where there is, it’s not easily searchable. Only a DAO (or its Wikipedia-type precursor) could mobilize and compensate the large number of experts and researchers needed to maintain a living encyclopedia for our exponentially growing crypto world.

- Of course, such a project suggests that financial media and "literacy" programs can generally be interesting cultural institutions. Imagine a 24/7 crypto CNBC—interviews with leading developers and investors, regulators, and politicians—but entirely managed by a DAO creator. Imagine crypto literacy programs to help potential investors understand leverage risks, liquidity, volatility, etc.

- On the other side of the crypto equation, computer science and crypto business courses would be valuable educational content products. Investing in these projects might be akin to community-type events that encourage you to support and contribute to the community.

- But there could also be other types of produced media, like films. Crypto is about enabling decentralization to promote creativity and prohibit censorship. So, how about a series of films about how creators and marginalized communities are using blockchain to empower and express themselves? Or artists and inventors who have fought centralized control in the past? How about an entire film festival?

- New thriving communities often invent and patronize their own musical culture, a sound and style that represents their unique perspective on the world. The 18th-century European bourgeoisie loved opera. Baby boomers had rock and roll. Just in time, we have DAO systems like Songcamp, where artists can collaborate and share results. Is this the melody of blockchain? Click and be surprised: ([https://twitter.com/songcampdotband/status/1389285939277701122?s=20](https://twitter.com/songcampdotband/status/1389285939277701122?s=20))

- It’s also not hard to imagine funding debate societies, legal and political conferences, lobbying efforts, or even full-fledged scientific and technological journals. We might even see funding for social IRL events, like Happy Hours, or their digital equivalents.

Of course, different protocols have different missions, and their communities will support their own distinct cultural products. A blockchain dedicated to reducing electricity consumption for climate purposes will foster creativity around ecological issues. And indeed, you can see this happening within the NFT community of Hicetnunc, minted on a chain that these artists consider better for the planet.

What’s really interesting about the relationship between the economy and culture is how culture reinjects into the economy. The crossroads cities that built sanctuaries and cathedrals for their often little-historic patron saints drew more traffic to their markets. These structures attract tourism and talent that root down and build on what already exists. And the seriousness of devotion to this culture has sparked a sense of civic duty that has prompted citizens to invest in and defend their cities.

We cannot underestimate the enormous emotional power that creative products infuse into the communities that invest in and adopt them. It often takes time for the full meaning of these products to emerge. Their potential impact is rarely obvious. The paths they take can be strange. Consider the song that became New York's anthem, played at sporting events, parades, and, especially, during the darkest hours of the Covid outbreak. "New York, New York" was written as the title of a forgettable 1977 Robert De Niro-Liza Minnelli film, then taken up by Sinatra. In a way, the words perfectly represent the city. Boom, boom, bah-de-dah. How many people have been subtly inspired to visit or settle in New York because of that? How many have found hope there in the past year? The song has become so embedded in the city's DNA that it is no longer the movie song or Sinatra’s song. It’s New York’s song.

We may be witnessing the beginnings of this type of cultural formation in crypto. In fact, it may even be supercharged, as crypto allows for the financialization of social and community activity in a way never seen before. This clearly shows the need and role of ambitious and thoughtful cultural governance now that structures, businesses, and creative behaviors are built on the foundations of the protocol. As proverbial neighborhoods sprout, subcultures will be built in reaction to the constructs, and its visitors and identity will evolve. In doing so, this activity will begin to spark critiques of how or what is built, by those most deeply invested in the protocol and the community it fosters. There will be disagreements. There will be overly kitsch and propagandist creations. But in the end, the protocols that can produce the most meaningful and sustainable communities, largely through content and cultural creation, will be the most enduring, richest, and most significant. In crypto, soft power is everything.
