The best framework for coordinating—and making a difference—may not be a choice between the two models, but a blend of both.

In 2014, a year before the launch of Ethereum, Trebor Scholz, an activist-academic and professor at The New School in New York, coined a new term: “platform cooperativism.” In a blog post, Scholz presented a bold alternative to the extractive Web 2.0 sharing economy: platforms that operated as cooperatives, collectively owned and controlled by their workers and users. The goal was to find ways to usher in a future where ride-sharing apps would belong to drivers, grocery delivery platforms would belong to personal shoppers, and sites like Patreon would belong to creators.

Since 2014, platform cooperativism has become a growing global subculture within technology. At conferences in New York, Hong Kong, and Berlin, loose community organizers and social entrepreneurs gather each year to support one another, share stories, and commiserate over the struggles of securing funding.

A few years ago, I founded a digital cooperative called Ampled, an artist-owned alternative to Patreon for musicians. More recently, I’ve also participated in several DAOs, including Forefront, Seed Club, and Friends With Benefits. Having one foot in the platform cooperativism movement and another in the DAO space has been enlightening, and I’ve come to believe that both spheres are giving rise to valuable new tools for human organization, collective ownership, and cultural production. While it may sometimes seem that these innovations occur in parallel isolation, I think these two communities can learn a lot from one another, even opening the door to meaningful hybrid approaches between the two.

Cooperatives, or "coops," are businesses whose ownership is shared by workers, customers, or both—and operate on a one-member, one-vote basis. While this ownership structure is fundamental to the cooperative model, its applications and cultures are varied. There are agricultural cooperatives, just as there are digital cooperative tech platforms. This article will mainly focus on worker and platform cooperatives, but other examples include:

**Cooperatives:**

- Consumer cooperatives
- Purchasing cooperatives
- Multi-stakeholder cooperatives
- Housing cooperatives
- Marketing cooperatives
- Producer cooperatives

DAOs, internet-native organizations coordinated by tokens that use blockchain as a foundation, also come in various forms. These include:

**DAOs:**

- Protocol/platform DAOs
- Creator DAOs
- Service DAOs
- Conservation DAOs
- Investment DAOs
- Social DAOs

While both cooperatives and DAOs are forms of collectively owned and co-determined organization, there are some essential differences. Primarily, cooperatives have one-member, one-vote governance. This means people vote, not dollars. No member of a cooperative can buy more votes than anyone else.

While it is possible for DAOs to mimic cooperative governance, it is more common to observe the easier-to-implement governance model of one token, one vote, as the verification of identity is still an emerging field in the blockchain world.

Setting aside the differences, there is a growing overlap in the idea spaces that DAOs and cooperative platforms inhabit. Both forms seek to expand collective ownership and governance of digital infrastructure. Both have a culture that prioritizes collective control and the creation of shared goods.

From my experiences in both spaces, I've noticed that DAOs tend to better facilitate large-scale collective ownership, even if their cultural understanding of the rights, responsibilities, and accountability associated with ownership is relatively underdeveloped. And while cooperatives tend to struggle more with securing funding, they are also more likely, through their sober rejection of capitalist realism, to properly address the root causes of inequality. Below, I will share some key takeaways I've gleaned on what DAOs and cooperatives can learn from each other.

### WHAT DAOS CAN LEARN FROM COOPERATIVES

**Historical Context**

People in the DAO space would be mistaken to believe that collective work and organizing modes are a technology-related invention. In reality, communities have practiced mutual aid and democratic ownership in nearly every corner of the world throughout history.

In America, the cooperative tradition has a neglected history of marginalized groups who were forced to create networks of solidarity to survive and become self-sufficient. In her book, *Collective Courage: A History of African American Cooperative Economic Thought and Practice*, Jessica Gordon-Nembhard, a professor at John Jay College, describes examples of economic coordination that free and enslaved African Americans engaged in hundreds of years ago, including pooling money to buy individuals their freedom and forming mutual aid societies and intentional communities. The Underground Railroad was itself a network of solidarity. These forms of cooperation predate the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, a British consumer cooperative founded in 1844 to widen access to quality food and provisions for skilled workers forced into unemployment by mechanization, widely cited as the foundation of the modern cooperative movement.

During the Great Depression, Americans created alternative networks for bartering and exchanging value, such as the Unemployed Exchange Association of Oakland. Because existing power companies deemed certain areas too unprofitable to serve, much of rural America was powered by electric cooperatives. The U.S. also has a rich history of community and local currencies, including Ithaca Hours and BerkShares.

DAOs have much to learn from these historical examples, particularly regarding non-hierarchical work modes and collective decision-making. It can also be instructive to study cooperatives that have failed in order to avoid mistakes. However, I would say that there are three areas where examining cooperatives and historical solidarity networks can be particularly instructive for DAOs: bringing people together around the struggle for racial and economic justice, fostering a strong sense of shared ownership, and building communities based on shared principles.

**Economic and Racial Justice**

Cooperatives often emerge as an attempt to address market failures and exploitative economic systems. They are designed to bring benefits to their members: good jobs, dignity, and collective agency. Because cooperatives are motivated by members' needs rather than profit, they are often guided by missions of racial and economic justice. There are no particular structural mechanisms that advantage cooperatives in focusing more effectively on social justice than DAOs; it is more a matter of founding motivations.

In contrast, in the crypto space, some of the most famous examples of collective economic organization have formed around memes or as exercises in commodification and speculation. Examples like PleasrDAO fracturing the Doge meme or ConstitutionDAO raising over $40 million to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution have value in that they suggest models for new forms of global economic coordination. So far, however, these DAO-fueled money swarms rarely seem to coalesce around goals that involve helping underserved individuals and communities meet their basic needs.

There are encouraging conversations around decentralized impact organizations, which could become a useful framework for allocating resources toward longer-term social impact outcomes. And while there are a growing number of mission-focused and mutual aid DAOs (including PleaserDAO's Free Ross DAO), these projects have not generated the same level of collective excitement, support, or resources. For those who want to use Web3 to make a difference, however, the stories of cooperatives like Cooperation Jackson and 40 Acre Co-op have much wisdom to offer when it comes to banding together to pursue a common goal and building an organization that reflects those values.

**Ambitious Definitions of Ownership**

Cryptographic networks and DAOs often use the concept of “ownership economy,” an idea first articulated by venture capitalist Jesse Walden, as a kind of guiding philosophical infrastructure.

“The ownership economy doesn’t always mean a literal distribution of tokens, stock options, or equity,” Walden wrote in an article describing the idea. “Rather, it means that ownership—which may manifest in the form of new economic rewards, platform governance, or new forms of social capital—can be a new cornerstone of user experiences, with plenty of design space to explore.”

By defining ownership this broadly, this argument risks diluting the concept of ownership to mean nothing more than “upside exposure” or a “sense of ownership.” As Cory Rosen, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership, has said: “A sense of ownership is like a sense of dining. But the concept of ‘ownership economy’ overlooks some of the essential principles of true ownership, such as giving members transparency into investments and agreements, a voice in hiring and other important decisions, and the ability to hold leaders accountable.

This is where cooperatives have a long history of expertise and a proven toolkit for creating strong shared ownership through legally enforceable means: bylaws, operating agreements, and ownership of intellectual property, in addition to clearly defined rights, responsibilities, and lines of accountability.

As DAOs continue to develop new forms of collective governance, it is useful to draw inspiration from smaller or older cooperative models, from the bylaws of the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, to the governance structure of Stocksy, to the decision-making matrix of Ampled.

**Shared Principles**

There is one more thing that cooperatives have in common: they tend to coalesce around a shared set of principles. The Rochdale Principles are a set of cooperative ideals developed by the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers. Nearly two centuries later, cooperatives worldwide still use them as a foundation.

The first three principles describe how cooperatives operate:

- Voluntary open membership
- Democratic member control
- Member economic participation

The other four principles describe shared virtues and values:

- Autonomy and independence
- Education, training, and information
- Cooperation among cooperatives
- Concern for community

Not all DAOs will be interested in adopting a shared set of principles. But for those of us motivated by cooperation, impact, and uniting around a common social or technological goal, it is important to ask the right questions: what will our shared values be? Do we want to prioritize transparency, participation, and collaboration, just as the open-source movement does? What we may discover, if we do enough introspection,

 is that we share many principles with the cooperative movement, including Principle 6: that DAOs should seek to collaborate with other DAOs.

As new entrants rush into the Web3 ecosystem to form DAOs, it may be helpful to develop a common set of principles that can guide us in building Web3—values that help us avoid recreating the dark patterns of Web2, and that could perhaps form the basis for collaboration between like-minded DAOs. The DWeb principles, a set of values that emphasize humanity and distributed benefits over “autonomous organizations,” are a good inspiration, although they are incomplete when applied to a worker organization. Merging the DWeb principles with the Rochdale Principles could be a good starting point.

### WHAT COOPERATIVES CAN LEARN FROM DAOS

**Rapid Experimentation**

In April 2021, the founder of Mirror, Denis Nazarov, took to Twitter to propose an idea for a tool called PartyBid that would allow groups of people to bid and buy NFTs. Shortly thereafter, PartyDAO came together, raised $100,000, and quickly built and shipped an impressive product that enables collective bidding and fractional ownership. Within a few months, this distributed team created a collectively owned platform that has since facilitated millions of dollars in offers.

Because DAOs are blockchain-based organizations that are generally not tied to a legal entity, they leave plenty of room for rapid experimentation in organizational design and incentives. Members can collectively find an idea, channel collectively managed resources toward shared goals, iterate, and ship quickly.

Cooperatives, on the other hand, often spend a lot of time discussing bylaws and incorporation processes with lawyers, making them considerably harder to create than a traditional corporation. Instead of being slowed down by the complex process of formalizing a traditional cooperative, it may be instructive to look at DAOs like PartyDAO, which have the ability to quickly ship products and increase impact—providing an initial proof of concept to build upon as an organization.

**Seeding Networks with Tokens**

Cooperatives have long suffered from a capital problem. Because they are inherently non-profit entities, eligibility for grants can be difficult. And because they are structured around group ownership and democratic collective control, they are functionally disqualified from accepting traditional venture capital investments, which require selling off a large portion of ownership to investors.

In addition to being powerful tools for coordination and voting, tokens can enable cooperatives to more easily get started when they lack liquidity. Helium, a distributed network for “LongFi” wireless internet infrastructure, provides one example. To power the network, people around the world install routers in their homes and offices as nodes of the network. The nodes are rewarded with $HNT, a native Helium token that represents governance power and holds value. Without this token and smart economic incentives, it’s hard to conceive how a decentralized network of this scale could take shape.

Members of a token community can also earn something tangible for their contributions. Tokens can be coded to automatically receive rebates when there is a revenue stream. This gives members or contributors the ability to capture the value they create, much like the time banking systems once used by offline solidarity networks.

**New Ways to Exit Community**

If a cooperative maintains a public or shared good, distributing tokens to early users of that good can be seen as a kind of loyalty reward: granting people automatic membership, voting rights, or ownership of a project based on past consumption or support.

One example is the recent token airdrop by Ethereum Name Service (ENS), a public utility that allows you to register a Web3 username ending in “.eth” that is associated with your Ethereum address. This allows people to send and receive Ethereum more easily without having to memorize long public keys.

ENS, which had been in development for over four years, was initially controlled by a small group of people. But they wanted to decentralize control and governance toward their community, so they evaluated users who had previously registered .eth domains and proposed an algorithm to fairly distribute 25% of the ENS supply to these users. After the initial distribution, users ended up having more control and power than the core contributors, who collectively received 18.96% of the token supply.

While cooperatives may want to stick to one-member, one-vote decision-making models, token airdrops can be a way to distribute rewards within loose, extended networks and attract more decision-making members into an organization.

For those who have advocated for exiting to the community or pathways for startups to transfer ownership to their employees and stakeholders as an alternative to IPOs or acquisitions, DAO airdrops can be a powerful tool for distributing community control.

**New Hybrid Models**

Unsurprisingly, several organizations are currently experimenting with blending the concept of DAO with the cooperative model. DisCo (Distributed Cooperative) is a framework that uses feminist economics to reorient our ideas about how DAOs can function more like traditional cooperatives. A few other examples include:

- ETHDenver, a conference and legal cooperative that recently launched a token
- Opolis, a digital employment cooperative that has launched a DAO and its own $WORK token
- Common Lands, a “decentralized autonomous housing cooperative” aimed at helping a million families become homeowners for the first time through affordable community-owned cooperative housing
- SongADAO, a DAO formed around the daily song releases of musician Jonathan Mann, which has recently incorporated as a legal cooperative

Ultimately, the best framework for an organization may not be a choice between a cooperative model or a DAO, but a blend of the two. Integrating cooperative values into cryptographic networks could take the form of a traditional cooperative seeding its network through on-chain symbolic contributions. Alternatively, a DAO might decide to adopt cooperative one-member, one-vote governance in certain cases.

By learning what we can from the past and looking toward the future, we can create communities that embody the best of both worlds: effective, principle-based organizations with sufficient resources that work toward building a more equitable, democratic, and collective future.
