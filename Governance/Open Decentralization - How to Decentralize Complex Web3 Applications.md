### **Open Decentralization: How to Decentralize Complex Web3 Applications**

Similar to the complete decentralization model, the open decentralization model includes a decentralized blockchain and a smart contract protocol layer, digital assets, and a DAO.

However, unlike the complete decentralization model, an open decentralization model would also have independent developers building and operating multiple clients (which can be centralized) on top of a shared smart contract protocol layer. For example, think of potentially rich and complex clients for Web3 social media that have similar features to Web2 applications like Twitter and Instagram, but all use a shared smart contract protocol instead of distinct proprietary backend systems.

![Open Decentralization Model for Web3](file:////Users/sebaastiencailhol/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.jpg)_This model assumes that the web3 system is a new smart contract protocol deployed on an existing programmable blockchain network. The "users" here refer to both consumers and contributors._

In this open decentralization model, all clients would utilize the digital assets of the underlying smart contract protocol, and their creation and operation would be incentivized as follows:

- **Initial Incentives**: Initial development could be incentivized through explicit and implicit incentives, including allocations of digital assets from the DAO-controlled treasury of the smart contract protocol; the network effects of the protocol; and the fact that these developers could retain the intellectual property rights of their respective clients.
  
- **Ongoing Incentives**: Continuous maintenance and development could be incentivized similarly, with asset-based incentives automatically allocated based on performance metrics established by the DAO. An example of this in DeFi is the [Liquity protocol](https://docs.liquity.org/), which rewards independent front-end website hosts that provide access to the protocol with rewards tied to the economic activity driven by those front-end sites to the protocol. In more complex Web3 systems, we would expect to see the prevalence of such rewards increase significantly. For instance, in a decentralized social media ecosystem, user engagement on a client could be measured and rewarded via tokens. Additionally, beyond protocol incentives, client operators would be incentivized by any financial return they can generate through their own proprietary clients.

Builders looking to decentralize their Web3 systems through the open decentralization model will need to design their incentive mechanisms and decentralized governance models to be "client-agnostic" to encourage participation from a variety of actors. Furthermore, they must ensure that no significant power imbalance returns to a single client in a way that allows it to dominate the entire ecosystem. If such imbalances could easily occur, builders of these clients might view the Web3 system unfavorably and be less willing to invest their time and resources in it. In some respects, such a system would have the same centralization and control issues as Web2 systems.

Builders using the open decentralization model must also prioritize transparency, open-source technology, data portability, and composability to further reduce the risk of power over their systems concentrating in the hands of developers. These features eliminate information asymmetry, lower barriers to entry for competing developers, and allow users to switch between clients, fostering a more open and decentralized ecosystem where users are not subject to the constraints or burdens imposed by a single client. (This is a significant obstacle in current Web2 systems, where user data is siloed within each captive Web2 system.)

Finally, for the decentralized economy of the system to be truly resilient, the success or failure of the entire Web3 system must not depend on any individual or group, including any single client. If this condition, as well as the economic decentralization conditions outlined above, are met in relation to a Web3 system, then the risk of significant information asymmetries arising in such a system would be greatly reduced, making it legally decentralized.

It may initially seem counterintuitive to suggest that builders should prioritize the design decisions above, as they effectively encourage their own competition. However, this will contribute to the formation of a functional decentralized economy based on shared infrastructure, which in turn will lead to a much larger and richer ecosystem than any single company could build on its own.

In other words: these actions enlarge the whole pie rather than prioritize a slice of it.

#### Web3 Versions of Web2

To see how these principles play out in practice, let’s apply the open decentralization model to create simplified Web3 versions of familiar Web2 applications. The promise of Web3 goes beyond merely disintermediating known functionalities and applications, as it enables entirely new possibilities; but I will focus on a few simple examples for illustrative purposes.

**Web3 Gaming** could involve a system with multiple games implementing a shared smart contract protocol and governance token; having distinct in-game currencies and NFTs; and allowing players and contributors to earn digital assets. These assets would also be transferable throughout the ecosystem. The most utilized games could then earn the largest percentage of governance tokens distributed by the system's DAO, prompting game creators to further fund the development of their games in return.

**Web3 Social Media** could involve a system with multiple iterations of social media and messaging services, each built as a distinct client on the same open-source smart contract protocol. Since the protocol would share a native governance token: consumers would earn tokens based on their usage, contributors would earn tokens based on the content they create, and clients would earn tokens based on various metrics established by the DAO.

**Web3 Markets** could involve a system where a collection of smart contracts and clients coordinate service providers while facilitating their interactions and planning with clients. Developers could then create white-labeled versions of these clients, allowing providers to offer many different levels of customized services or products. Both clients and service providers would earn the same governance token based on their contributions to the system. There is an increasing number of [examples](https://www.notboring.co/p/braintrust-fighting-capitalism-with) of how Web3 companies are already using tokenomics to create and capture long-term value.

Ultimately, the open infrastructure—composed of the blockchain network and smart contract protocol in this model—provides a rich environment for a variety of specialized products and services to be built on top of its layers. By utilizing this shared infrastructure, builders can create Web3 products and services at a fraction of the cost of building centralized Web2 applications from scratch.
