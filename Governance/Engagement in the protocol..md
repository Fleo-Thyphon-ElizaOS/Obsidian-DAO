**Candidate Evaluation Criteria**

- **Engagement to the Protocol**: What is the candidate's level of commitment to the protocol and its governance?
- **Subject Matter Expertise**: What is the candidate's background, and how does it qualify them to participate?
- **History of Engagement**: What is the candidate's history in terms of community engagement, and how are they generally perceived publicly?
- **Absence of Conflict**: Does the candidate have any outstanding conflicts of interest with the protocol, or ways they could benefit from the protocol's failure?
- **Alignment with Protocol Success**: Is the candidate positively aligned with the long-term interests of the protocol?
- **Independence from a16z**: Is the candidate completely independent from a16z to ensure the independence of their vote after delegation?
- **Impact on Decentralization**: Will delegating to the candidate further contribute to the decentralization of governance power within the network?
- **Diversity of Perspectives**: Will delegating to the candidate increase the overall diversity of perspectives within governance and help avoid groupthink?
- **Sense of Overall Stewardship**: Does the candidate embody a stewardship ethic and believe in the underlying mission of the protocol?

We score candidates on a scale of 0 to 2 points for each category (based on the complete set of questions included in the rubric), and generally look for a minimum score of 70% or higher for candidates to progress. As you can see in the table below (which shows our current scores for Uniswap delegates), there are many different ways to achieve a passing score, with no specific training or profile required.

**Legal Mechanics and Document Models**

For candidates who meet the bar, we conclude a brief agreement that defines the basic terms of the delegation. We publish our agreement template here. Like the evaluation rubric, this is the template we use for our existing delegates. Below are the key terms we include, along with our justification:

- **Participation**: We ask delegates to stay informed and participate in a way they reasonably believe is in the best interest of the protocol. Beyond that, they are free to participate as they see fit.
- **Amount of Delegation**: We aim to give each delegate enough tokens to have a significant impact on governance, measured by a relevant metric (for example, enough tokens to introduce a proposal).
- **Reimbursement**: We provide each delegate with a modest sum to ensure all their expenses are covered. This is always a de minimis amount ($500/month or less) and is designed to cover items such as gas fees incurred for voting and submitting proposals.
- **Duration and Termination**: We commit to maintaining the delegation for a minimum period (at least six months), with the possibility of revocation only under very limited circumstances. Beyond those, we cannot revoke the delegation during its term, even if the delegate votes against us at every vote. This ensures that delegates are empowered to vote independently and in the manner they deem appropriate.
- **Renewal**: At the end of the initial duration, our delegations renew by tacit agreement unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Once a delegate is integrated, they are free to participate in governance as they see fit. We occasionally check in with our delegates, but otherwise, they are entirely independent of us once we have made the original delegation.
