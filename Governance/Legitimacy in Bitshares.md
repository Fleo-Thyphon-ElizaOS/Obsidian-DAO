### Legitimacy in Bitshares

One of the long-forgotten yet, in my opinion, very innovative ideas from the early cryptocurrency space was the [socialconsensus model](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=http://web.archive.org/web/20140209035756/https://invictus-innovations.com/social-consensus/) of [Bitshares](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?PHPSESSID%3Dh7u4curkvqm5dn9gs9q3end8j0%26topic%3D5.0). Essentially, Bitshares described itself as a community of people ( [holders of PTS and AGS](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic%3D1964.0)) who were willing to collectively support an ecosystem of new projects, but for a project to be welcomed into the ecosystem, it would have to allocate 10% of its token supply to existing PTS and AGS holders.

Now, of course, anyone can create a project that allocates no coins to PTS/AGS holders, or even fork a project that has made an allocation and withdraw the allocation. But, as Dan Larimer says:

You can't force anyone to do anything, but in this market, everything is a network effect. If someone proposes a compelling implementation, you can onboard the entire PTS community for the cost of generating a new genesis block. The individual who decides to start from scratch will have to build a whole new community around their system. Given the network effect, I suspect that the coin that honors ProtoShares will win.

This is also a conception of legitimacy: any project that makes the allocation to PTS/AGS holders will receive the attention and support of the community (and it will be worthwhile for each individual member of the community to care about the project because the rest of the community does as well), and any project that does not make the allocation will not. **Now, this is certainly not a conception of legitimacy that we want to replicate verbatim—there is little appetite in the Ethereum community to enrich a small group of early adopters—but the basic concept can be adapted into something much more socially valuable.**

### Extending the Model to Ethereum

Blockchain ecosystems, including Ethereum, value freedom and decentralization. But the ecology of public goods in most of these blockchains is, unfortunately, still quite authority-focused and centralized: whether it’s Ethereum, Zcash, or any other major blockchain, there is typically one (or at most 2-3) entities that spend far more than everyone else, leaving little room for independent teams wanting to build public goods. I call this public goods funding model "Central Coordinators of Capital for Public Goods" (CCCP).

**This state of affairs is not the fault of the organizations themselves, which generally do their best to support the ecosystem. Rather, it is the rules of the ecosystem that are _**unfair to this organization**_, as they keep the organization at an unjustifiably high level.** Any single centralized organization will inevitably have blind spots and at least a few categories and teams whose value it does not understand; this is not because anyone involved is doing something wrong, but because such perfection is beyond the reach of small groups of humans. Therefore, it is very helpful to create a more diverse and resilient approach to funding public goods to alleviate the pressure on a single organization.

Fortunately, we already have the seed of such an alternative! The Ethereum application layer ecosystem exists, is becoming increasingly powerful, and is already demonstrating its civic responsibility. Companies like Gnosis have contributed to the development of Ethereum clients, and various Ethereum DeFi projects have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Gitcoin Grants matching pool.

Gitcoin Grants has already achieved a high level of legitimacy: its public goods funding mechanism, [quadratic funding](https://vitalik-ca.translate.goog/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp), has proven to be [neutral](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/) and effective in reflecting the priorities and values of the community and filling the gaps left by existing funding mechanisms. Sometimes, the main beneficiaries corresponding to Gitcoin grants are even used as a source of inspiration for grants by other, more centralized granting entities. The Ethereum Foundation itself has played a key role in supporting this experimentation and diversity, incubating efforts like Gitcoin Grants, as well as MolochDAO and others, which then receive broader community support.

We can make this emerging ecosystem of public goods funding even stronger by adopting the Bitshares model and making one modification: instead of giving the strongest community support to projects that allocate tokens to a small oligarchy that purchased PTS or AGS in 2013, **we support projects that contribute a small portion of their treasuries to the public goods that make them possible and to the ecosystem they depend on**. And, most importantly, we can deny these benefits to projects that fork from an existing project and do not give back value to the broader ecosystem.

There are many ways to support public goods: committing long-term to support the Gitcoin grants matching pool, supporting the development of the Ethereum client (also a reasonably neutral task since there is a clear definition of what an Ethereum client is), or even managing one's own grant program whose scope goes beyond that particular application layer project itself. The simplest way to agree on what counts as sufficient support is to agree on how much—for example, 5% of a project's expenditures go to support the broader ecosystem and an additional 1% goes to public goods that extend beyond the blockchain space—and rely in good faith on choosing the destination of that funding.
