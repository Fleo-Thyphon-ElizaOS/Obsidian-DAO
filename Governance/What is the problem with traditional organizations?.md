## Concentration of Power vs. Decentralization

A child born in 2001 in the African country of Rwanda will have known only one president throughout their life, and due to a recent change in the constitution, this could be true until 2034. Of the 150 million km² of continental land on Earth, they will have only 26,338 km² to traverse and share with 12.6 million others, with very little hope of moving to a more spacious or prosperous place. A fundamental question posed by the DAO movement is that if the Earth belongs to all of us, why is it acceptable for some to imprison others in limited regions?

The answer is that historical precedents have concentrated power in the hands of a few chosen individuals who have used their power to restrict the life chances of millions of individuals born free.

An important element of this historical precedent is the organization of money, particularly the control of monetary protocols by powerful banking and political institutions. For example, the [stock of U.S. currency](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL) has been unilaterally inflated by 120% over the past ten years by the Federal Reserve, forcing asset prices to soar well beyond the reach of simple currency holders, whose purchasing power has more than halved. As these disparities worsen over generations, it becomes almost impossible for workers to accumulate the capital necessary to create businesses and other organizations.

The alternative to this is not to futilely work to reform old systems, but to abandon them and build better ones. To do this, DAOs replace centralized power structures with autonomous software cores that anyone can connect to and use to manage their own project. This is not a declaration of war but rather a competition.

In this vein, the DAO movement has completely disengaged from the [fiat money system](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) and has instead built on internet currencies (cryptocurrencies) such as Ethereum, which have fixed monetary policies that can only be modified by consensus, not by the whim of a few individuals.

A DAO cannot, by itself, remove people from authoritarian regimes, but it can loosen their grip by bypassing state banks and capital controls and offering citizens greater control over their own lives. The ability to form and join decentralized businesses, communities, and organizations can constitute its own capital that cannot be easily confiscated. Those who build and use DAOs bet that decentralized organizations—freed from the burdens of geography and regulation—will be much better than traditional organizations at creating value.

Governments are extreme examples of concentrated power, but the business landscape is just as unequal. The underrepresentation of women and minorities in leadership positions has been well documented, and traditional pathways through education and networking may obscure systemic barriers to access. Compare this with a DAO that is permissionless by design and often anonymous, meaning that anyone can join regardless of age, gender, skin color, or any other superficial characteristic. To clarify, it is technically possible to restrict access to a DAO by distributing its tokens only to specific individuals, but the vast majority of DAOs are open and meritocratic, with very shallow hierarchies, reminiscent of cooperatives.

However, the biggest flaw of offline organization is by far that every government action is an experiment on living patients. [Stephen Kotkin](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Kotkin) estimated that around 65 million people were killed by social engineering projects under communist regimes between 1917 and 2017. Instead of conducting many small-scale experiments with low failure costs, state leaders used their power to conduct enormous experiments on entire populations at an incalculable cost. This is as absurd as it is tragic. The DAO approach is much more rational, with a culture of building software primitives for governance and voting that can be tested, combined, and recombined in countless rapid experiments with very low failure costs. DAO communities are integral to this process as they participate in daily testing and suggest improvements.

DAOs are also public, meaning that anyone can see where payments have been received and sent on blockchain explorers like [Etherscan](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://etherscan.io/). Such radical transparency automatically fulfills many of the reporting requirements imposed by regulation, but more importantly, it allows for fierce scrutiny by millions of motivated investors, who currently comb through all available data on crypto projects and raise alarms with much more urgency than underfunded ministries ever could.

This evokes the best that humanity has to offer: the innate desire to contribute to something greater than ourselves and beyond profit.

[As identified by EY Ireland](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://www.ey.com/en_ie/consulting/9-steps-to-become-a-purpose-led-organisation), creating a purpose-driven organization requires several prerequisites:

1. Belief
2. Committed direction
3. Integrated purpose
4. Clear communication
5. Aligned and consistent incentives and performance indicators
6. Autonomous people
7. Established core values

As they currently exist, DAOs are set up to meet all these requirements:

**Belief**

DAOs are permissionless to join and require the purchase of a governance token to participate. This structure alone is self-selecting of members who have a proactive belief in the founding purpose of the DAO. On [Aragon Govern](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://aragon.org/aragon-govern), this founding purpose is enshrined in a constitutional agreement that outlines the purpose of a DAO and for which members can be held accountable by [the Aragon Court](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://aragon.org/aragon-court).

**Committed Direction**

Engaged members—motivated by a common goal—naturally produce committed leadership. This is no more evident than when the first action of a leader is to terminate the legacy organization that preceded the DAO, as Shapeshift founder Eric Voorhees did earlier this year.

**Integrated Purpose**

Traditional hierarchical structures, by depriving lower-level employees of the resources needed to achieve determined objectives, tend to stifle innovation. Similarly, upper management is accountable to no one below them, which can create resentment when projects are poorly managed or promises are unfulfilled. In contrast, DAOs are horizontal organizations with very few—if any—command and control structures. Members are free to call for votes on proposals at any time, and if they are tied to on-chain executions, a successful vote will deterministically release funds for the proposed project or department. Thus, the finality arising from the actions of DAO members is directly integrated into the functioning of the organization.

**Clear Communication**

Various communications on channels such as Discord or Telegram are an integral part of the daily operations of a DAO. However, progress is only made when conversations turn into concrete proposals that members can vote on; only a positive vote will trigger the release of funds. This inherent feature of DAOs is a latent discipline factor on all internal communications and naturally imbues the organization’s culture with expectations of clarity and conciseness.

**Aligned and Consistent Incentives and Performance Indicators**

DAOs replace most operational guts of an organization with a software stack. That being said, solving operational problems such as incentive mechanisms and performance indicators can be as simple as installing a plugin. A recent example of this in practice was when Aragon [partnered with UMA Protocol](https://blog-aragon-org.translate.goog/uma-kpi-options-airdrop-now-live-for-aragon-govern-daos/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp) to integrate key performance indicator options into Aragon Govern to incentivize DAOs to migrate their treasuries from Aragon Client.

**Autonomous People**

DAO members are fully empowered to suggest, vote, and—provided the proposal is adopted—execute proposals using a variety of tools. For example, [Aragon Voice](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://voice.aragon.org/) allows any ERC20 token holder to request proposals from other token holders for the benefit of the network.

It is worth noting that the pursuit of collective goals within DAOs is strictly voluntary. This eliminates the political angst that has undermined large historical attempts to pursue collective objectives. Since DAO membership is permissionless and guarantees against centralization are cryptographically enforced, power within DAOs is genuinely distributed, and collective goals are not pursued at the expense of individual freedom.

**Established Core Values**

Core values such as decentralization of power and universal suffrage are directly programmed into the Aragon technology stack. This means that projects emerging from it necessarily inherit these core values. This is extremely important for pioneering projects such as [the women-led DAO from Zebpay](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://zebpay.com/blog/the-worlds-first-women-only-dao/), which allows women to build capital in a traditionally patriarchal society by participating in the male-dominated tech sector. As ecosystems like that of Aragon grow, positive feedback will only increase, and even more likable projects will transform into DAOs, further reinforcing these core values.

The ability to reuse open-source components is the superpower that makes building in Web3 extremely efficient. Teams can leverage enormous amounts of existing, reliable code and focus only on creating the missing components for their project. This exponentially increases the rate of experimentation and innovation. Not having to reinvent the wheel (or fear being pursued by regulators and patent trolls) every time you create a business makes Web3 more efficient at allocating resources than Web2.

Achieving the equivalent in Web2 would somehow mean convincing Nintendo to share a database with Sony and Microsoft or, back in the finance world, for eTrade to execute trades on Robinhood. The likelihood of this happening is fundamentally zero: even if Web2 companies were not all competing against each other, they are built on incompatible technology stacks that prevent them from reusing each other's software.

In addition to digital possessions, Web3 also allows users to transfer their identity and reputation across dApps. Instead of logging in with a username and password, users use their Web3 wallet to selectively grant read-only access to their ERC20 address, which acts as a unique identifier and reputation metric. Having a verifiable "CV" of token purchases, dApp interactions, and DAO memberships has led to the [“Degen(erate) score](https://translate.google.com/website?sl=en&tl=fr&hl=fr&client=webapp&u=https://degenscore.com/)” as an ironic ranking of Web3 literacy, but which is already included by sincere candidates in Web3 job applications. In this way, identity and reputation can be viewed as currencies backed by Web3 activity. Like any currency, on-chain identities can be exchanged and traded (with all the confusion this implies), as well as form the components of an abstract social network that will shape digital communities, working groups, and new types of "nations."

Web2 companies are known for building competitive "moats" to insulate themselves from competition. These can take the form of favorable regulations, aggressive patent enforcement, high switching costs, hoarding data, and many other self-preservation strategies. However, none of these strategies make sense in the open-source, permissionless, and transparent world of Web3. Instead, organizations must assume that their code will be reused by others and make it the forefront of their growth strategy; composability turns plagiarism from an extreme risk in Web2 into a central assumption and strategic goal in Web3. In such an environment, organizations must become experts in collaboration and symbiosis:

1. Be immediately intelligible to newcomers
2. Feel like a natural progression
3. Avoid favoring founding members over new members who contribute heavily

One example of these tools that make life easier for DAO contributors is the "multi-signature wallet." A multi-signature wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that allows you to manage your community's crypto assets, with the ability to require a predefined number of signatures to confirm transactions. It requires multiple team members to ensure that every transaction is executed, preventing unauthorized access to the funds in that wallet. No one can walk away with all the money because it would require the approval of all other members. It gives ownership to contributors and provides an open view of the DAO's treasury.

Depending on how the DAO is set up, it may be more difficult to coordinate and act quickly compared to centralized leadership like a CEO who makes quick decisions if necessary. However, a DAO could establish quorums that do not take too long and set requirements regarding the responsiveness of DAO members. Additionally, in the early stages, when there are many decisions to be made, there might be more centralization among certain members, and then the DAO can decentralize over time in what is called "progressive decentralization."

There is also the possibility of voter apathy where not all members will want to vote or may not even be the most qualified to vote on all changes. In this case, there will likely be voters who delegate to members who may be more informed and active in voting and who also align with their beliefs. These representatives are sometimes called protocol politicians because they often campaign for delegated votes from DAO members, just as existing politicians do. On the other hand, one day we might even see DAOs lobbying and becoming major political institutions in society themselves.

If you are not ready to start a DAO, interested individuals in the space can make a living by working for one. To understand how to proceed, we will go through a hypothetical hiring process and break down the different steps, including:

1. Choosing your discipline
2. Finding the right role
3. Onboarding
4. Collaborating
5. Getting paid

**Choosing Your Discipline**

When it comes to working for a DAO, it can be difficult to know where to start. What roles exist in DAOs? What talent is actually needed?

The good news is that it’s simpler than you think. While there are certainly many variations depending on the purpose of the DAO itself, there are a few common roles.

**Community Managers.** DAOs are, of course, communities. This makes this role particularly important—the moderators and managers are the glue that holds the project together and helps it move forward.

**Recruiters and Promoters.** Especially in the early days, DAOs need to evangelize, attracting great people to the project. Recruiters are valuable here.

**Scribes.** Huge amounts of information are created and disseminated through DAOs. Writers can be influential by clearly recording this information and contributing to marketing and traditions.

**Artists.** NFTs have become a popular way for DAOs to generate revenue. Artistic abilities and sensibilities can therefore be highly sought after.

**Engineers.** Some DAOs have begun to create their own tools or other products in the Web3 space. If you are a coder or wish to become one, DAOs offer an opportunity to learn.

**Treasurers.** As mentioned, DAOs manage large AUM. They need fiscally savvy operators to help manage and effectively deploy their spending.

This is far from exhaustive, of course. Game designers, digital marketers, and all sorts of other functions are helpful to DAOs.
