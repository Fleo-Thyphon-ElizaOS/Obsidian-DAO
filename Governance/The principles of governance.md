The governance of a blockchain protocol is multidimensional and concerns several aspects, such as governance independence, financial governance, compliance with current standards, and adherence to the objectives and values upheld by the project. The various aspects of blockchain-related governance may include:

- The distribution and allocation of responsibilities.
    
- The security and confidentiality of data.
    
- The organization of changes and modifications to the project itself.
    

The governance of a blockchain project is multidimensional, thus encompassing different aspects, both on-chain and off-chain:

**Legal Aspects:**

- **On-chain:** Does the project comply with GDPR standards?
    
- **Off-chain:** Is the project legal from the perspective of a judicial authority?
    

**Financial Aspects:**

- **On-chain:** Is price manipulation (Pump & Dump of listing...) by an entity within the project possible?
    
- **Off-chain:** Where do the funds financing the project come from? Have KYC/AML procedures been followed? Who is funding the project?
    

**Security Aspects:**

- **On-chain:** Have the smart contracts been sufficiently audited, and are the funds secure? Does the code of the smart contracts allow for rug pulls by the founding team?
    
- **Off-chain:** Is the veracity of the information provided by oracles reliable? Are the databases used hackable?
    

**Functional Aspects:**

- **On-chain:** Is the protocol easily interoperable between different blockchains?
    
- **Off-chain:** Do the interface solutions have weaknesses? Is the user experience (UI/UX) satisfactory for the protocol's users?
    

**Organizational Aspects:**

- **On-chain:** Has the distribution of roles and powers among actors (miners, developers, users, investors...) been well thought out?
    
- **Off-chain:** Have the roles of the team been clearly defined? Will these roles help sustain the project? What is the founder's role in the project?
    

**Examples of aspects to consider when defining governance:**

- **Management of permissions and restrictions:**
    
    - The creation of multi-sig wallets.
        
    - Who has access to the funds?
        
    - When does decentralization come into play?
        
- **Tokenomics and token distribution policy:**
    
    - Delimiting parameters regarding the use of the token.
        
    - Traceability policy.
        
    - Economic incentive regimes (marketing solutions or liquidity contribution solicitations).
        
- **Organizational distribution and relationships among protocol actors:**
    
    - Protection against malicious acts (internal or external).
        
    - Modes of technical and functional reorganization (forks, on-chain or off-chain processes).
        

Governance is therefore not simply a set of rules that we issue; it also involves means of control, sanction procedures, possible reward procedures (such as grants), performance indicators, or compliance criteria. All these questions must be thoroughly considered to propose governance that is as beneficial as possible to the project, the protocol, and all its participants.

Voting can occur directly on the blockchain or via a snapshot or a forum where voting is possible. Most of the time, it is preferable for a vote to be signed by a wallet to ensure and verify simply that the vote was indeed cast by a token holder.
