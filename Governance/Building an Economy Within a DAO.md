# Building an Economy Within a DAO

This essay is based on a talk I gave at [Crypto, Culture, & Society](https://cryptosociety.notion.site/cryptosociety/Crypto-Culture-Society-01f39bcff26b422183061e6011b16892), which builds a liberal arts education for crypto.

While more complex activities have migrated to the digital world, our tools for digitally native coordination have not evolved at the same pace. DAOs are emerging as a defining coordination mechanism, but they are still in their infancy. To reach their full potential, DAOs—like nation-states—must strive to create thriving internal economies that serve their missions.

This article explains how DAOs can create internal economies, utilize their native tokens and treasuries to serve their objectives, and apply models from economics, history, and anthropology to function effectively.

## **I. How to Build an Economy**

### **Why Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and China Succeeded**

Joe Studwell’s book [How Asia Works](https://www.amazon.com/How-Asia-Works-Success-Failure-ebook/dp/B00B3M47VC) details the economic models implemented by Asian governments, including Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, China, and others, to build prosperous economies.

The success of these countries goes against the conventional economic ideas put forth by Western universities and institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. Unfettered free markets can be detrimental to underdeveloped economies. The successful Asian economies have been intentional about which parts of their economies they open and when they open them.

The strategies cited in the book include:

- **Land Reform**: Distributing land from inefficient feudal landlords to small farmers
- **Immigration Policy**: Allowing certain skilled workers, restricting foreign land ownership
- **Import-Export Policy**: Subsidizing exports and imposing tariffs on strategically important imports
- **Local Industry Protection**: Protecting local farmers and manufacturers from foreign competition
- **Currency Protection**: Devaluing the currency to make exports more competitive
- **Special Economic Zones**: Designating zones like Shenzhen with more economic autonomy
- **Tax Incentives**: Providing tax subsidies to local industries

Countries like Taiwan, South Korea, and China started with a lot of land and a relatively uneducated workforce. Training citizens for highly skilled jobs in areas like information technology and financial services was too costly. Instead, governments adopted land reform policies that distributed land to the agricultural workers who farmed it.

Smaller plots of land operated by incentivized farmers led to increased productivity and crop yields, which boosted household incomes. The success of agriculture, in turn, fed local manufacturing industries. Because manufacturers could not get rich through local consumption (the local economy wasn’t rich enough), they had to focus on exports to the United States, Europe, and other wealthier economies.

The way to stimulate exports is not to fully open the economy but to be selective and create special economic zones and offer tax subsidies to strategically important industries. Governments would selectively reevaluate currency; China, in particular, is famous for devaluing its currency so that its exports would be competitive on the global market.

While these strategies may not be viable in the long term, they are important in the early stages of economic development. An economy needs a solid foundation before it can be fully opened to foreign competition.

### **Applying a Successful Economic Model for Governments to DAOs**

So, what happens when we apply the Asian model of building an economy to the construction of a DAO?

Let’s take the example of how it has looked for [Friends With Benefits](https://www.fwb.help/).

- **Land Reform: Broad Symbolic Distribution**
  
  Just as East Asian governments allocated land from feudal landlords to workers, it’s important for DAOs to distribute tokens to a wide range of participants, allow contributing individuals to earn tokens, and potentially have an inflationary token supply to dilute inactive older participants in favor of new active ones.

  FWB has done one of these things, namely setting up multiple working groups for members to earn tokens in exchange for their contributions to the DAO.

- **Immigration Policy: Token-Gated (75 FWB) and Scholarships**
  
  FWB offers membership to anyone who holds 75 FWB tokens and gets their application approved by the FWB team. They also have a scholarship program for selected applicants.

  Unlike an open border policy, this manages DAO members during the early days.

- **Currency Protection: Liquidity Provision and Treasury Diversification**
  
  A large portion of the FWB token supply is held by the Treasury, so the circulating supply is limited. The treasury is deployed selectively by the organized community.

  FWB manages their liquidity program. Most large liquidity providers are trusted members of FWB who will not sell their positions on a whim.

- **Special Economic Zones: FWB Cities, FWB Gatekeeper, FWB Radio**
  
  You can consider sub-DAOs as loosely defined special economic zones. They are delegated powers and provided with some funding to produce specified products or services.

- **Tax Incentives: DAO Treasury Funding**
  
  FWB is a state and must provide public goods for people to operate within that state. Just as a government grants tax subsidies to industries that benefit the country, FWB provides treasury funds for activities that help it pursue its mission.

  The FWB treasury has funded a token locking product, an editorial covering weekly FWB news and events in various cities.

### **Designing Tokens and Treasury as a Decentralized and Programmable Game**

A DAO is an internet-native organization whose critical rules are governed by smart contracts rather than legal contracts. You can encode important elements like membership, ownership, key assets, or community ownership on-chain. And on the edges, you have humans governing critical parts of the DAO, such as the shared bank account or treasury, protocol upgrades, and changes to the DAO constitution.

Today, most protocol DAOs allocate 40 to 60% of their native tokens to a community treasury, which is then allocated through on-chain governance. The challenge is that on-chain governance is slow and inefficient, meaning that practically no native tokens are allocated.

However, the rules for allocating native tokens over time can be encoded at the outset of the DAO’s formation. By defining these rules, DAOs create a game that builders, users, market actors, and other stakeholders can participate in to earn native tokens.

### **Bitcoin Block Rewards: A Game with Transparent Rules that Created Economic Activity**

Bitcoin provides an excellent example of this idea in action. Bitcoins are created as a reward for mining, which fulfills an important function of using computational power to verify and record new Bitcoin transactions. The incentives put in place by its creator, Satoshi, have led to a whole ecosystem and economy of participants mining Bitcoin, including mining companies like Bitmain, hydroelectric plants in [Italy](https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/miningweek/2022/03/25/how-northern-italian-hydropower-producers-became-bitcoin-miners/) and [Costa Rica](https://www.reuters.com/technology/costa-rica-hydro-plant-gets-new-lease-life-crypto-mining-2022-01-11/), ASIC miners designed to mine Bitcoin, and more.

While the Bitcoin model is not without its critiques, it has established a transparent means for market actors to earn Bitcoin that has been very successful.

### **Curve: An Open and Attack-Resistant Mechanism Leading to Complex Economic Behavior**

Curve is another example of a protocol with a very transparent system for distributing native tokens, rewarding participants, and creating utility for those tokens. On Curve, you can lock your tokens in a voting escrow, and they are subject to Curve’s vesting schedule. By locking your tokens, you can not only accrue more tokens but also vote on the distribution of token rewards and the addition of new gauges to the protocol.

[A whole ecosystem](https://defieducation.substack.com/p/the-great-curve-wars?s=r) with lots of activity both inside and outside the DAO has emerged based on the rules that Curve has created for using and allocating its tokens.

For example, Convex Finance emerged as a protocol that dissociates governance and economic rights from Curve holders. [As Kydo states](https://llama.mirror.xyz/UCz1P9cRT860Pi7-D9H968U-H3cxCxg3icGpZHVkGVQ), a group of people within Curve Finance wanted to maximize their yield on their CRV (their agenda). However, their individual votes were not enough to move the needle. So they pooled their voting power (unionization) into Convex Finance (the union) to achieve this. Holders can forfeit their Curve governance rights to Convex while retaining the economic benefits of veCRV (vote-escrow Curve), which include trading fees, yield, and CVX rewards. Additionally, holders can bribe veCRV holders to vote on the issuance of rewards to particular pools via [Votium](https://votium.app/).

### **Alliances Between DAOs**

Inter-firm relationships are strict while DAO-to-DAO relationships are fluid. B2B relationships are defined by legal contracts, proprietary software, and private negotiations with the top executives of the company. D2D relationships are defined by smart contracts, messages on governance forums, open-source software, and public negotiations with the DAO community, token holders, and the core team.

D2D collaborations are closer to alliances between nation-states than to corporate mergers and acquisitions. A significant D2D token swap resembles a NATO agreement, which serves in part to mutually protect each other and avoid stepping on each other's toes. Yearn is a good case study—they have helped several protocols like Pickle, Rari Capital, and Alchemix when they were exploited. This helps Yearn establish a trustworthy

 relationship with other DAOs.

When the code is open-source and forkable, what you want to “acquire” is the development of the community and ecosystem around the protocol. This cannot be done by force.

Successful collaborations will involve product integrations, resource sharing, assistance during attacks, and increasing the economic value of both DAOs. Collaborations will also involve participation in each other’s governance. Collaboration exists as long as both communities desire it. If you implement the token swap via a Sablier flow, both DAOs can cancel the flow or sell the tokens at any time.

## **II. Barter and Gift Economy**

### **The Financialization of Everything**

Crypto allows almost anything to become financialized—from an open-source protocol to a meme to a person’s future income. The financialization of everything combined with the ability to trade anything for anything else via decentralized exchanges like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) and [Sushiswap](https://www.sushi.com/) indicates that we are entering a vaguely defined barter economy.

Anything can compete to be money. It’s easier than ever to create an asset from anything, and it’s also easier than ever to trade assets for one another.

### **Liquidity is to Web3 What Bandwidth Was to the Web**

As exchanges become more commonplace (and more important to the economy), liquidity also becomes more important.

[A useful analogy](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/liquidity-is-bandwidth?s=r) is that whatever bandwidth was provided in the era of the internet, liquidity provides in the era of blockchain. Bandwidth is the speed at which data flows across the network, and liquidity is the ease with which you can exchange your asset for something else. Having large amounts of both is what enables a DAO economy to thrive.

### **A Gift Economy Within DAOs**

Many anthropologists disagree with the commonly held belief that barter economies evolved before credit- or currency-based economies, which was propagated notably by the 18th-century economist and philosopher Adam Smith. In practice, many anthropologists have instead suggested that early economies were [gift economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy) based on generosity and reciprocity (e.g., I give you something you need, and at some point, you return it in some way).

This seems to emerge in intra-DAO interactions. As trust builds within a DAO, members cultivate the belief that they will someday be rewarded for their efforts to advance the DAO’s mission.

The problem with web3, however, is that every interaction has the potential to become transactional. DAOs must ensure that this does not become part of the culture as it devalues the intrinsic and social motivations of members. The best DAOs will operate an internal gift economy, even as they are more transactional with other DAOs.

### **Endless Treasuries and Infinite Time Horizons**

It is important to have permanent capital because some projects require a longer time horizon and an inexhaustible funding source. [Chinese monasteries](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23729988.2019.1639463) and university endowments were built with this understanding—funds will need to exist in perpetuity.

DAO treasuries often fund long-term open-source projects, which means funding will need to last as long as possible.

As always, there are exceptions based on project goals—whether for a DAO or a traditional institution. For example, the Gates Foundation plans to spend all its resources within twenty years of Bill and Melinda's death so that they can focus on the most urgent problems today.

### **Socialists Meet Capitalists in DAOs**

DAOs are interesting because they contain elements of both socialism and capitalism, two different ideologies. There is an emerging hybrid model of both libertarian beliefs that everything can be financialized and that money should not be controlled by a centralized entity AND the leftist vision that labor should own more of the economy, not just wages. That’s why web3 contains a multitude of political opinions—because people can be drawn to it for different reasons, and both sides can be right.

In many ways, DAOs offer a better model for coordination and property distribution than some of our existing structures. Successful DAOs will create a thriving internal economy that animates their mission. They must be intentional about how they use their native tokens and treasury to support and develop their communities.
