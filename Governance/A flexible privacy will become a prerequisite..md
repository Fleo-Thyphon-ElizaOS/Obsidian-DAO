### **_Flexible Privacy Will Become a Prerequisite._**

Today, all on-chain activities and the majority of governance activities are transparent. However, total transparency presents serious challenges that threaten the growth of DAOs as productive vehicles, particularly concerning internal governance, talent acquisition, and innovation.

First, without certain guarantees of privacy, DAO stakeholders are vulnerable to off-chain coercion, which threatens the integrity of the DAO's governance. Without procedures to anonymize the voting process, external parties can target individual stakeholders to influence decisions normally reserved for direct stakeholders, which can disrupt the typical alignment between DAOs and stakeholder interests. As the stakes increase, so does the possibility that harmful forces will work to sway outcomes.

Second, without flexible privacy options, DAOs face an unnecessarily limited talent pool for hiring. Despite the general preference in the ecosystem for transparency, public salary negotiations and salary flows remain unpopular among individual workers in the space. While pseudo-anonymous workers are certainly prevalent in early stages, it is unlikely to become the standard mode of operation in the medium to long term.

Finally, without basic privacy options regarding their workers and products, DAOs risk discouraging innovation and experimentation from their developers. The ability to identify individual contributors on the blockchain can lead to undesirable individual consequences for work done on behalf of the DAO, which may, in turn, discourage the kind of risk-taking that often leads to technological breakthroughs in the space. For example, without a certain element of privacy, a developer deploying a buggy smart contract exposes themselves to real-world backlash and liability. While the likelihood of these negative outcomes may be low, default protection should be adopted by DAOs building consequential technology.

Inevitably, privacy versus transparency among DAOs will exist on a spectrum, but without a certain blend of both, progress may stagnate for some organizations.
