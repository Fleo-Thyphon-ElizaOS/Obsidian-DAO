**7 Levels of Delegation**

**Why We Don’t Use Coercive Power (1)**

Management, as it was invented 100 years ago by Taylor, has served us well in the industrial age. The division between the thinking of a few at the top telling many at the bottom what to do has allowed us massive efficiency gains. However, when applied to intellectual work rather than physical labor, these benefits mostly disappear and are countered by disengaged intellectual workers who are paid to think.

Division (left) and union (right) of decision-making and execution.

The hierarchy of coercive power operates through delayed or interrupted feedback loops that prevent decision-makers from personally feeling and experiencing the impact of their decisions. This leads to slow and poorly informed decisions, which are too static for increasingly dynamic and complex markets.

We avoid these downsides by distributing decision-making to autonomous cross-functional teams rather than functional departments. In distributing decision-making, we consider these two principles:

- The people who ensure that a decision is implemented make the decision.
- The people affected by a decision should be able to contribute to it.

This structure and these principles foster the following ways of making decisions.

We aim for a decision distribution of approximately:

- 90% by individuals: safe-to-fail and mandate,
- 9% by groups: group consent process,
- 1% by individuals deciding for groups: advisory process.

The rest of this article explains how and when we use each of these decision-making practices.

**Deciding for Yourself (2) When It Is Safe to Fail**

When faced with a decision, we first consider reversibility and consequences before moving on to another decision-making practice. For decisions that are easily reversible or have little consequence, we choose to make decisions ourselves. Many one-off operational decisions fall into this category. In these cases, "ask for forgiveness, not permission" is the best option because it is quick and creates momentum.

Irreversible but inconsequential decisions are a good training ground for learning. Making mistakes here is cheap, and the lessons learned can be used to avoid more costly errors. For example, you might discover who has a strong opinion and valuable input on equipment after purchasing an adapter yourself (€50). Now that you know, you can consult them before making a larger purchase, such as a laptop (€2000).

Decisions that have large consequences but are easily reversible are ideal for experimentation. You can quickly revert after gathering evidence that your decision was a poor choice. Congratulations. Now you can discuss facts instead of opinions. For instance, you might choose to do a project with a candidate as a freelancer before making them a full-time employee offer.

When decisions are both (strongly) consequential and (almost) irreversible, we choose to make them carefully and methodically using one of the following practices.

**Deciding (2) with a Mandate**

The simplest case for making decisions is when you have a mandate to do so—either given by a group for which you are deciding or by a role you are fulfilling. Most case-by-case operational decisions fall into this category.

We avoid creating role descriptions that are detailed checklists of specific tasks because we believe they lead to "stupid" behavior of the type "It's not my fault. I just followed the rules." However, we find it very helpful to make explicit the mandates of roles with high-level decision domains that allow for leadership and accountability.

Example: This might involve you in your role as a recruiter rejecting a candidate after an initial screening. You wouldn’t inform anyone of this decision you make daily, even though it is not easily reversible and has significant consequences. If someone asks you about a specific decision, we expect you to explain your reasoning—to sell your decision, if you wish. This helps others understand and accept your choices while allowing them to learn from it.

**Agreeing (4) in a Group with Consent**

When there is no mandate for someone to make the decision, we default to group decision-making by the affected group using the group consent process. We prefer consent over majority voting or consensus. While consensus is generally interpreted as everyone being for a proposal, consent means that no one is against a proposal. At first glance, this may seem the same and merely a semantic game. But only until you realize that next to "I prefer" and "I oppose," people have a third position: "I tolerate."

Personal positions regarding a proposal: I prefer, I tolerate, and I oppose.

In a group, "No one opposes it" (consent) equals "We tolerate." "We tolerate" leaves much more room for solutions than "We prefer" (consensus).

Collective positions map (inspired by Richard D. Bartlett)

Making positions explicit and visual helps discussions move forward. It is much easier to track someone else's position when I feel I have been heard and understood.

For consent to work well, it is essential to understand what a motivated objection is and what it is not. A motivated objection is not "I would prefer another option," but "I believe doing this will harm us and risk our goal." Objections are not vetoes that stop a proposal but identified risks to integrate into an amended proposal. They are the beginning of a discussion, not the end. When we frame objections as suggestions on how to modify the proposal to make it acceptable, discussions become much more solution-focused.

We value this bias for action because it pushes us to experiment, gather data, and iterate. Sociocracy uses the slogan "good enough for now, safe enough to try" to describe the experimental nature of consent-based decision-making. With this, consent tends to lead to faster agreements and smaller experiments.

Example: Teams use the group consent process to decide things that affect everyone in the team, such as their goals for the next three months. Most strategic and long-term policy decisions at the team level fall into this category.

If we cannot agree as a group, we escalate: we choose a decision-maker who follows the advisory process. Choosing a decision-maker tends to be as simple as someone suggesting a person from the group, and the rest of the group agrees. Technically, this is another (meta) decision of consent, but it is generally much easier to make.

**Decide After Consulting Others (3) with the Advisory Process**

For cases not covered above, we default to the advisory process. We do this for decisions in large groups where we find group consent too inefficient or after having tried and failed to obtain consent within a group.

We draft proposals in a shared space (e.g., a wiki or file-sharing drive) where people can see progress and comment throughout the decision-making process. We use a template to communicate our intention to make a decision on a subject. With a message to the affected group, the initiator proposes who decides what, when, and why it is important now. This makes decision-making transparent and allows the affected group to contribute.

We expect decision-makers to actively consult experts and stakeholders. It is not enough to send a proposal and passively wait for feedback. This has a subtle side effect: asking someone for advice is a way to show appreciation—showing that their opinion is valuable in finding a good solution.

The greater the impact of a decision, the more people we consult. The opinions received must be considered. But advice is just advice. The ownership of the problem clearly belongs to one person: the decision-maker.

**Steps of the Advisory Process**

Decision-makers ensure that everyone is engaged in the decision, including those who disagree. They talk to them before publicly communicating their decision. They explain that they have heard them, understand their viewpoint, and why, despite this, they decided differently. There is no need to make watered-down decisions to please everyone. People respect decisions if they feel they have been heard and understood.

If we disagree with a decision, we practice forgiveness and talk to the decision-maker about it. We follow the conflict resolution process if necessary.

Example: We use the advisory process for decisions that alter our organizational structure, such as creating a "reference" group for people who are temporarily without a team, or decisions that affect people throughout the company, like switching to a new recruitment tool. Who makes decisions with the advisory process?

To be clear: we do not have dedicated decision-makers. You become a decision-maker by identifying an important and urgent decision to be made and taking the initiative or being chosen by a group of people unable to decide something using the group consent process.

Decision-making is not evenly distributed among all, and some voices carry more weight than others. People with more social capital influence decisions more than others. Every group of people has hierarchies of reputation and merit. An equal distribution of decision-making has never been the goal. The aim is inclusion and openness, allowing those who feel a sense of urgency to take initiatives.

Expertise in a particular field often influences who makes a decision, but it is not the only criterion that makes someone a good candidate for decision-making. Understanding all perspectives, the ability to carefully weigh options, or social capital with the affected group may be more important in certain circumstances.

**Pitfalls to Avoid**

Decision-makers must be willing to question their initial assumptions and solution ideas and return to the problem space. This is difficult because our brains operate with natural biases. We tend to choose information sources that are not representative (selection bias). And to make matters worse, we tend to distort the information we receive to seek confirmatory evidence instead of trying to refute our assumptions (confirmation bias). We cannot completely avoid these biases, but being aware of them and the difference between the problem space and the solution space helps.

The advisory process can initially be uncomfortable. While it is easy to appreciate intellectually, it is emotionally challenging. It requires detaching from the ego's attachment to being right and instead trying to shift perspectives to see what one is struggling to perceive.

**Adoption Struggles**

Adopting decentralized decision-making does not happen overnight after transitioning from a coercive power hierarchy with supervisors to autonomous teams. Three phenomena we have experienced are seeking permission, slow decision-making, and resistance.



**Seeking Permission**

It took some effort to shed the reflex of asking for permission. It is helpful to have leaders who resist the urge to "just make the call" when someone "gives" them a decision to make. Instead, these are learning moments to ask, "What do you need to make this decision yourself? Who will be affected? Who is an expert?" This, in turn, requires trust in everyone's positive intent and competence to relinquish decision-making power. It is challenging because uncertainty is uncomfortable—more so than being wrong.

**Slow Decision-Making**

Another source of friction is the speed of decision-making with the advisory process. Consulting people takes time. Considering their advice takes time. Making the process transparent takes time. Therefore, more time elapses between the intention to make a decision and its actual making. However, decision-making is a means to an end. We want something to happen after making a decision. If part of the desired effect is for people to change their behavior, it is overall more effective to include them in the decision-making process than to try to convince them once the decision has already been made. Involvement creates commitment.

Integrated reflection time and diverse perspectives lead to more diverse proposals and, ultimately, better decisions that align more with our company values and the future we want to create rather than with individual belief systems.

**Resistance**

Resistance is naturally part of decision-making as people change at different paces. Collaborative decision-making makes this resistance more transparent, often leading to frustration on the part of the decision-maker. However, making resistance more visible also makes it easier to address and overcome.

**Conclusion**

If we want to make progress, we must make decisions. By decentralizing decision-making, we enable decisions—and thus progress—to be made at any point in the organization while also gaining more engaged colleagues in the process.

Decentralized decision-making requires more effort than someone making the call because they are higher in a power hierarchy. We know that. It is the trade-off we make to allow greater autonomy for teams and individuals, ultimately leading to more innovative products and more fulfilled people. Being clear about which decision-making practice to use in which context helps mitigate the downsides of this trade-off.

**Practices with Expected Distribution, Decision-Making Speed, and Characteristic Types of Decisions.**

As with so many things, distributed decision-making is simple—only 2 principles and 4 practices—but not easy. For it to work well, you also need to become at least decent in areas such as empathy, nonviolent communication, conflict resolution, leadership, accountability, goal alignment, and personal time management.
