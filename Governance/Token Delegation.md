### **Best Practices for Token Delegation**

Over the past year, we have worked with dozens of delegates across a number of leading protocols. Below are some of the best practices we have identified throughout this process, which we believe will be useful to others.

**Delegate Early.**  
Delegation can be beneficial at any stage of a protocol's lifecycle. However, it may be most impactful during the early days when a protocol is active but the native token is not yet widely distributed. During this period, delegation is valuable for several reasons. Firstly, it can accelerate the distribution of governance power ahead of the pace dictated by the token issuance schedule. This is particularly important in protocols with long distribution cycles, where it may take years for a governance token to diffuse broadly throughout the community. In such cases, delegation helps increase short-term engagement by giving more participants a voice in the process. It can also help foster the growth of a higher quality governing body over the long term (more details below). Given that these effects compound over time, it is helpful to incorporate delegation as early as possible.

**Elevate Community Leaders.**  
Delegation provides a way to elevate community members who show early leadership in governance. These are typically active users who understand the protocol and want it to thrive but otherwise lack sufficient tokens to participate meaningfully. We have seen many examples to date where an individual or small team demonstrates leadership, earns token delegations, and uses those tokens to drive significant upgrades to the protocol. This, in turn, generates further delegations, upgrades, etc., creating a virtuous cycle. Identifying and elevating these types of leaders from within through delegation contributes to the long-term benefit of the protocol.

**Recruit Outside Perspectives.**  
Delegation provides a tool for incorporating new perspectives into a protocolâ€™s ecosystem for the first time. These are often individuals or groups interested in crypto who bring valuable and unique skills but have not yet had the opportunity to get involved. Since delegation typically requires little or no upfront cost to them, it provides the very important foot-in-the-door that is usually all they need to start contributing. We have seen this firsthand in many cases, having delegated to a number of nonprofits and students, many of whom have since become leaders in their new governance communities. This helps increase diversity both within protocol governance and across the broader crypto ecosystem.

**Ensure Delegates' Independence.**  
Delegates should be empowered to vote independently of the token holder. This is an essential property for any well-designed delegation program. At a minimum, this means that the token holder should not attempt to influence or dictate their delegates' participation in any way, either explicitly or implicitly. We recommend going further by having the token holder commit to maintaining their delegations for a minimum period, with the option to revoke early under very limited circumstances (e.g., ongoing non-participation in votes). There are likely other ways to deepen this concept, but in general, this type of mechanism gives delegates the assurance that they can vote as they see fit.

**Ensure Ongoing Transparency.**  
As delegation becomes increasingly common, it will become increasingly important for token holders to provide ongoing transparency to their networks of delegates. This gives the community visibility into the parties involved, the terms of the underlying delegations, their relationships with the token holder, and so on. It will also allow the community to benefit from further iterations on these mechanisms by opening them up for public review and feedback. We are committed to maintaining this type of transparency in our own program going forward and encourage others to do the same.

### **Criteria for Evaluating Delegates**

When we assess potential candidates, we evaluate them based on a number of key criteria. In general, these are designed to identify delegates who we believe would significantly enhance the governing body and become long-term leaders within the community. We have published our complete evaluation rubric here, which we used to rate all of our existing delegates. Overall, we focus on the following areas:
