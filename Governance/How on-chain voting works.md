It is important to note several key differences between traditional voting and on-chain voting. In the absence of identity in blockchain networks, we cannot use one-person, one-vote systems, and we wouldn’t want to either, as they can lead to a tyranny of the majority. Instead, we see one-token, one-vote systems that allow voters to express the intensity of their preference. At this stage of the crypto space, this means total plutocracy—this is a recognized problem and can be improved by several mechanisms, among which quadratic voting reduces the impact of wealth on voting power. Alternatively, community members could be allocated a certain number of votes per month through a symbolic drip to equalize the distribution of voting power.

Pioneers in the blockchain space are wildly experimenting with new tools for human collaboration, but we must still ask ourselves whether we are carrying unnecessary baggage from our old voting systems. What other assumptions can we discard to further streamline large-scale distributed decision-making? What about the assumption that voting must be time-limited?

Attack vectors present in time-limited on-chain voting:

Vote buying, plutocracy, and Sybil attacks are tactics that a wealthy bad actor can use to unfairly influence a voting process. Respectively, these terms refer to 1) bribing other voters to vote a certain way, 2) buying a significant amount of tokens to amplify one’s vote, or 3) spreading their token holdings across multiple accounts to gain undue influence over a decision. These issues affect many current on-chain voting systems.

Last-minute vote swings—seen in several on-chain voting scenarios, time-limited voting is particularly susceptible to manipulation in the moments leading up to its end. Strategic voters wait to see early results before weighing in with their vote at the end of the session to tip the balance in their favor. This problem is partially mitigated by mechanisms such as silent vote waiting, which extends the duration of a vote in the event of a last-minute change in the outcome (although this approach is vulnerable to systematic obstruction as an attack vector) or PLCR voting, which retains the results of a secret vote until polling closes, but also introduces additional UX difficulties and potential liquidity complications caused by arbitrary token lock periods.

Voter apathy on-chain—if we thought our voter turnout for political elections was bad, participation in on-chain voting has so far been even worse, with as little as 3.8% of voting tokens participating in the last Aragon AGP vote. It turns out that despite all our discussions about decentralized governance, few people actively engage with it! On-chain voting systems struggle with a smooth user experience, where voters may be required to send multiple transactions to confirm a vote within tight deadlines, all on clunky blockchain user interfaces. This low voter turnout could easily lead to results that do not accurately represent the community's sentiment, which is undoubtedly a huge flaw in these new decentralized decision-making systems. So let’s continue to seek improvements!
