We distinguish two main types of governance, both centralized, that we are accustomed to seeing in our post-industrial societies:

- **Private governance** for the private sector, which includes everything related to corporate governance: corporate committees, decisions within companies, governance of associations or unions.
    
- **Public governance** for the public sector: in political thought, we find concepts of global or worldwide governance, territorial or local governance, depending on the governance scales considered.
    

In the crypto ecosystem, we will attempt to add a decentralized character to governance. This opens up new fields of research and application for an already known concept: the system of DAOs, currently the most popular, which relies on tokens that grant voting rights.

In any case, some components remain the same, whether we consider centralized or decentralized projects. Thus, we can say that governance is essential to any well-managed project.

At the genesis of a project, governance is often reduced to its simplest expression; it is often very centralized around the development team. It is indeed quite logical that the development team decides how decisions will be made at the beginning of a project. These decisions will initially address all legal, financial, and organizational aspects of the protocol.

Once a project matures, the need for decentralization will first manifest through tokenomics, namely the distribution of tokens by the protocol to the various stakeholders of the project: developers, team, investors, advisors, users, which must be balanced... All this reflection must take place upstream and will be crucial as it will determine what value the protocol can create for its users, teams, and investors. Indeed, if a team holds 95% of the circulating tokens, governance is very centralized since the tokens and therefore the voting rights are highly centralized within the team, which will then make the final decisions on each proposal. Similarly, it is also essential to consider the treasury aspect of the DAO during the token distribution to ensure the project can advance. The Yearn team, for example, after having distributed 100% of the YFI, had to mint a few thousand more to finance teams, grants, and future developments. This news was not necessarily well-received as it had not been planned beforehand, highlighting the importance of retaining a proportion of governance tokens within the DAO.

Another aspect of governance to consider in terms of (de)centralization is the channels that allow everyone to express themselves about the protocol. Most often, governance discussions take place on tools like Discord, Telegram, or Snapshot, managed by administrators who are mostly integral members of the project team. There is currently no better solution, but it is quite imaginable that some protocols might remove and censor proposals that do not suit them. This aspect is therefore not entirely decentralized, and it is essential to be aware of this. Often, governance protocols use the snapshot process to consider community votes because it allows for two types of voting:

- **On-chain votes:** each person votes with the tokens in their wallet by signing an Ethereum transaction (when gas fees are high and/or token holders have few votes, abstention can be quite significant).
    
- **Snapshots:** allow for a larger number to vote since it involves a one-time snapshot of the token holders’ balances at a specific block. However, this process allows everyone to seek and vote for what they consider best for the protocol.
