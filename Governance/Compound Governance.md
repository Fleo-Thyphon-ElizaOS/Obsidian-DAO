### Protocols and Their DAOs

The voting page of Compound, available [here](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals?target_network=mainnet), aggregates all proposals that have been made, canceled, or rejected by the governance of the protocol. For example, [Proposal 32](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/32), submitted in December 2020, proposed the distribution of COMP tokens to users affected by the oracle issue and the increase of DAI to $1.30 on Coinbase, which triggered a wave of liquidations. We see a vote with "For" or "Against," where "Against" overwhelmingly won at 76%.

These proposals include:

-   Voters, some of whom are identified wallets (Polychain Capital, Argent, Kyber Network, ConsenSys) and others that are still pseudonymous (0x…).
-   The addresses of the relevant contracts.
-   A description of what will be done, the necessary mechanisms to achieve it, the methodology...
-   A link to the topic published on the Compound Governance forum.

The site [comp.xyz](http://comp.xyz) serves as the discussion forum for the governance of the Compound protocol (similar to Aave) where users can engage live on proposals (notably on Proposal 32 [read here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compensation-proposal-distribute-comp-to-affected-users-in-the-dai-liquidations/801)), freely sharing their opinions and explaining their upcoming votes. Before proposals are voted on, they are subjected to discussion on the forum, allowing for improvements to the proposals or shedding light on direct consequences they might have on the rest of the protocol and synergies with other protocols.

### A Relatively Centralized Governance

One can view Compound as a sort of proportional participatory democracy, where large holders have significant voting power. For instance, regarding the vote on Proposal 32, it is noted that Polychain Capital accounts for nearly 50% of the "Against" votes. Here, decentralized governance is, in reality, rather centralized, reminiscent of a plutocratic system like MakerDAO, where the majority of MKR is held by a small circle of individuals. Thus, it is crucial for a decentralized protocol to decentralize governance tokens as much as possible and to offer a better distribution of these tokens to avoid too much concentration in a few hands. Of course, these large holders have a vested interest in ensuring the governance of the protocol is conducted properly, but it can happen, as was the case with Uniswap, that proposals are voted on that do not benefit the majority of the community. Certain proposals can indeed be voted on and implemented because a small group of users holds significant voting power.

### Snapshot

Compound uses Snapshot very little for pre-voting. However, it is possible to find a large number of DeFi projects such as Balancer, Yearn, Sushi, Uniswap, Bancor, PancakeSwap, and Badger on the [Snapshot](http://snapshot.org) site. All DeFi protocols use this platform to interact with their community and offer the advantage of being able to vote without incurring gas fees. The tool sometimes provides a semblance of decentralization to protocols that are not directly managed by a DAO and do not have the necessary tools to provide a high level of decentralization. Votes can be conducted on Snapshot collectively, and the development team members are subsequently responsible for manually implementing the proposals since the implementation is not automated via the DAO’s smart contract.

### Reminder of the Steps for Implementing Decentralized Governance:

**Step 1**: An initial centralization around the Genesis team that will decide what is best for the protocol and implement the first smart contracts to offer a functional project.

**Step 2**: Opening the DAO with votes on platforms like Snapshot to allow interaction with the protocol through the DAO but still in a centralized manner.

**Step 3**: Interaction with the protocol via a fully autonomous DAO, which will allow for the automatic implementation of smart contracts and enable the organization to be completely decentralized and autonomous.
