### Deep Fundamental Vulnerability of Token Voting to Attackers: Vote Buying

The problems escalate once determined attackers attempting to subvert the system enter the scene. The fundamental vulnerability of token voting is simple to understand. **A token in a voting protocol is a bundle of two rights combined into a single asset: (i) a form of economic interest in the protocol's revenue, and (ii) the right to participate in governance. This combination is deliberate: the goal is to align power and responsibility. But in practice, these two rights are very easy to decouple from each other.** Imagine a simple wrapper contract that has these rules: if you deposit 1 XYZ into the contract, you receive 1 WXYZ. This WXYZ can be converted back to XYZ at any time, and additionally, it generates dividends. Where do the dividends come from? Well, while the XYZ tokens are inside the wrapper contract, it is the wrapper contract that has the ability to use them as it wishes in governance (making proposals, voting on proposals, etc.). The wrapper contract simply auctions off this right daily and distributes the profits among the initial depositors.

As a holder of XYZ, do you have an incentive to deposit your coins into the contract? If you are a very large holder, perhaps not; you appreciate the dividends, but you fear what a misaligned actor could do with the governance power you are selling them. But if you are a small holder, then you really do. If the governance power auctioned off by the wrapper contract is purchased by an attacker, you personally only incur a small fraction of the cost of the bad governance decisions your token contributes to, but you personally gain the full benefit of the dividends from the auctioning of governance rights. This situation is a classic tragedy of the commons.

Suppose an attacker makes a decision that corrupts the DAO for their benefit. The harm per participant resulting from the successful decision is \(D\), and the probability that a single vote tips the outcome is \(p\). Suppose an attacker bribes a participant \(B\). The game matrix looks like this:

| **Decision** | **Benefit to You** | **Harm to Others** |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Accept the bribe from the attacker | \(B - D \times p\) | \(-999 \times D \times p\) |
| Reject the bribe, vote your conscience | 0 | 0 |

If \(B > D \times p\), you are inclined to accept the bribe, but as long as \(B < 1000 \times D \times p\), accepting the bribe is _collectively_ harmful. Thus, if \(p < 1\) (typically, \(p\) is well below 1), there is an opportunity for an attacker to bribe users into adopting a net negative decision, compensating each user much less than the harm they suffer.

A natural critique of voter corruption fears is: will voters _really_ be immoral enough to accept such obvious bribes? The average DAO token holder is an enthusiast, and they would find it hard to feel good about selling the project in such a selfish and blatant way. But what is overlooked is that there are much more obscure ways to separate profit-sharing rights from governance rights, which do not require anything as explicit as a wrapper contract.

The simplest example is borrowing from a DeFi lending platform (for example, [Compound](https://compound.finance/)). Someone who already holds ETH can lock their ETH in a CDP ("collateralized debt position") on one of these platforms, and once they do, the CDP contract allows them to borrow an amount of XYZ up to, for example, half the value of the ETH they locked. They can then do whatever they want with this XYZ. To retrieve their ETH, they will eventually have to repay the XYZ they borrowed, plus interest.

Note that throughout this process, _the borrower has no financial exposure to XYZ_. In other words, if they use their XYZ to vote for a governance decision that destroys the value of XYZ, they do not lose a dime as a result. The XYZ they hold is the XYZ they must eventually repay to the CDP, so they do not care whether its value goes up or down. **Thus, we have achieved decoupling: the borrower has governance power without economic interest, and the lender has economic interest without governance power.**

There are also centralized mechanisms to separate profit-sharing rights from governance rights. Notably, when users deposit their coins on a centralized exchange, the exchange has full custody of these coins, and the exchange has the ability to use these coins to vote. This is not mere theory; there is evidence of exchanges using their users' coins in several DPoS systems. The most notable recent example is the [hostile takeover attempt of Steem](https://decrypt.co/38050/steem-steemit-tron-justin-sun-cryptocurrency-war), where exchanges used their clients' coins to vote for certain proposals that helped cement a takeover of the Steem network, which most of the community strongly opposed. The situation was only resolved through a mass exodus, where a large part of the community moved to a different chain called [Hive](https://hive.io/).

Some DAO protocols use time-locking techniques to limit these attacks, requiring users to lock their coins and make them immobile for a certain period to vote. These techniques can limit short-term buy-vote-sell attacks, but ultimately, time-lock mechanisms can be circumvented by users holding and voting with their coins through a contract that issues a wrapped version of the token (or, more trivially, a centralized exchange). **In terms of security mechanisms, time-locks are more like a paywall on a newspaper website than a lock and key.**

Currently, many blockchains and DAOs with token voting have so far managed to avoid these attacks in their most severe forms. There are occasional signs of attempted bribery:

But despite all these significant issues, there have been far fewer examples of outright voter corruption, including obscure forms such as the use of financial markets, than simple economic reasoning would suggest. The natural question to ask is: why have there not been more direct attacks yet?

My answer is that the "why not yet" rests on three contingent factors that are true today but are likely to become less true over time:

1. **Community Spirit**: having a very tight-knit community, where everyone feels a sense of camaraderie in a shared tribe and mission.
2. **Strong Concentration of Wealth and Coordination of Token Holders**: large holders have greater capacity to influence outcomes and invest in long-term relationships with each other (both the "old boys' clubs" of VCs, but also many other equally powerful yet less-known groups of wealthy token holders), making them much harder to bribe.
3. **Immature Financial Markets** in governance tokens: ready-made tools to create wrapper tokens [exist in proof-of-concept forms](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/bypassing-smart-contract-timelocks/) but are not widely used, corruption contracts [exist](https://gitlab.com/relyt29/votebuying-carbonvote) but are also immature, and liquidity in lending markets is low.

When a small, coordinated group of users holds more than 50% of the tokens, _and_ they and others are invested in a very tight-knit community, and few tokens are lent at reasonable rates, all the above corruption attacks may remain theoretical. But over time, (1) and (3) will inevitably become less true no matter what we do, and (2) _must_ become less true if we want DAOs to become more equitable. When these changes occur, will DAOs remain safe? And if token voting cannot sustainably withstand attacks, then what can?
