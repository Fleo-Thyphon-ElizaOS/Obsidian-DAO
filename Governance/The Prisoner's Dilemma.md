### The Prisoner's Dilemma

A famous example of a coordination failure is the Prisoner's Dilemma. The Prisoner's Dilemma is an example of a situation analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even when it appears to be in their best interest to do so.

Here’s the [example](https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2016/09/13/game-theory-in-a-variety-of-fields-prisoners-dilemma-economics/#:~:text=Two%20members%20of%20a%20criminal,of%20communicating%20with%20the%20other.&text=Each%20prisoner%20is%20given%20the,the%20other%20by%20remaining%20silent.): Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in isolation with no way to communicate with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the main charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each inmate a deal. Each inmate has the option to either betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are:

1. If A and B betray each other, each will serve two years in prison.
    
2. If A betrays B while B remains silent, A will be released and B will serve three years in prison.
    
3. If A remains silent while B betrays A, A will serve three years in prison and B will be released.
    
4. If A and B both remain silent, they will each only serve one year in prison (for the lesser charge).
    

Because betraying a partner offers a greater reward than cooperating with them, all purely rational and self-interested prisoners will betray the other, meaning that the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is that they betray each other.

In reality, humans display a systematic bias toward cooperative behavior in this game and similar games, despite what is predicted by simple models of "rational" self-interest action. The more trust the participants involved had in each other, the more they worked together for the best common outcome.
