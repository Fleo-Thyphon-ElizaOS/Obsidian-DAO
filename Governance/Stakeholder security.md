The ecosystems of Bitcoin and Ethereum spend significantly more on network security—specifically the objective of proof-of-work mining—than on everything else combined. The Bitcoin blockchain has paid an average of about **$38 million per day** in total rewards to miners since the beginning of the year, plus approximately **$5 million per day in transaction fees**. The Ethereum blockchain comes in second, with $19.5 million/day in block rewards and **$18 million/day in transaction fees**. Meanwhile, the annual budget of the Ethereum Foundation, which funds research, protocol development, grants, and various other expenses, is only **$30 million per year**. Non-Ethereum Foundation funding exists as well, but it is at most a few times larger. R&D spending in the Bitcoin ecosystem is likely even lower. Bitcoin's ecosystem R&D is largely funded by companies (with a total of $250 million raised so far), suggesting about **$20 million per year** when assuming fairly high salaries and that many paid developers are not counted.

Clearly, this spending model is a massive misallocation of resources. The last **20%** of the network’s hash power provides *much* less value to the ecosystem than those same resources would have if they had been devoted to research and development of core protocols. So why not simply reduce the PoW budget by 20% and redirect the funds to those other areas instead?

The standard answer to this puzzle has to do with concepts like "public choice theory" and "Schelling fences": even if we could easily identify some valuable public goods to redirect funding to, what constitutes a *regular institutionalized model* of such decisions carries risks of political chaos and capture that are not worth it in the long run. But whatever the reasons, we are faced with this interesting fact: **the organizations that are the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems are able to amass billions of dollars in capital, yet they have strange and hard-to-understand restrictions on where that capital can go.**

The powerful social force that creates this effect is worth understanding. As we will see, it is also the same social force that explains why the Ethereum ecosystem is able to gather these resources in the first place (and why Ethereum Classic, which is technologically almost identical, does not). It is also a social force that is essential to helping a chain recover from a 51% attack. And it is a social force that underlies all sorts of extremely powerful mechanisms well beyond the blockchain space. For reasons that will become clear in the following sections, I will name this powerful social force: **legitimacy**.

### Coins Can Be Held by Social Contracts

To better understand the force we are getting at, another important example is the epic saga of Steem and Hive. In early 2020, Justin Sun acquired Steem-the-company, which is not the same as Steem-the-blockchain but held about **20% of the STEEM token supply**. Naturally, the community did not trust Justin Sun. They proceeded to hold an on-chain vote to formalize what they considered a long-standing "gentleman's agreement" that the coins of Steem-the-company were held in trust for the common good of Steem-the-blockchain and should not be used for voting. With the help of coins held by exchanges, Justin Sun counterattacked and took control of enough delegates to unilaterally control the chain. The community saw no other options in the protocol. Instead, they created a fork of Steem-the-blockchain called Hive, copying all STEEM token balances—except those of Justin Sun and others who participated in the attack.

The lesson we can draw from this situation is: *Steem-the-company never really "owned" the coins*. If they had, they would have had the practical ability to *use, enjoy, and abuse* the coins as they pleased. But in reality, when the company tried to exploit and abuse the coins in a way that the community did not like, *it was successfully stopped*. What is happening here is a model of a kind similar to what we have seen with the unissued Bitcoin and Ethereum coins: the coins were ultimately not held by a cryptographic key, but by a kind of *social contract*.

We can apply the same reasoning to many other structures in the blockchain space. Consider, for example, the root multisig of ENS. The root multisig is controlled by seven prominent members of the ENS and Ethereum community. But what would happen if four of them were to get together and "upgrade" the registrar to one that transfers all the best domains to themselves? Within the ENS smart contract system, they have the full and uncontested ability to do so. But if they actually tried to abuse their technical capability in this way, what would happen is clear to everyone: they would be excluded from the community, the remaining members of the ENS community would enter into a new ENS contract that restores the original domain owners, and every Ethereum application using ENS would redirect its user interface to use the new one.

This goes well beyond smart contract structures. Why can Elon Musk sell an NFT of his tweet, but Jeff Bezos would have a much harder time doing the same? Elon and Jeff have the same level of ability to capture Elon’s tweet and stick it into an NFT application, so what’s the difference? For anyone with even a basic intuitive understanding of human social psychology (or the *fake art scene*), the answer is obvious: Elon selling Elon’s tweet is *the real thing*, while Jeff doing the same is not. Once again, millions of dollars of value are controlled and allocated not by individuals or cryptographic keys, but by social constructs of legitimacy.

And going even further, legitimacy governs all sorts of social status games, *intellectual discourse*, language, property rights, political systems, and national borders. Even blockchain consensus works the same way: the only difference between a soft fork accepted by the community and a 51% censorship attack after which the community coordinates an *off-protocol recovery fork* to eliminate the attacker is legitimacy.

## What Is Legitimacy?

*See also: my previous article on [blockchain governance](https://vitalik-ca.translate.goog/general/2017/12/17/voting.html?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=fr&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wapp).*

To understand how legitimacy works, we need to dig into game theory. There are many situations in life that require **coordinated behavior**: if you act alone in a certain way, you probably won’t get anywhere (or worse), but if everyone acts together, a desired outcome can be achieved.

An obvious natural example is driving on the left or right side of the road: it does not matter which side of the road people drive on, as long as they drive on the same side. If you switch sides at the same time as everyone else and most people prefer the new arrangement, there can be a net benefit. But if you switch sides alone, no matter how much you prefer to drive on the other side, the net result for you will be quite negative.

Now we are ready to define legitimacy.

**Legitimacy is a higher-order acceptance model. An outcome in a certain social context is *legitimate* if people in that social context widely accept and play their role in implementing that outcome, and each person does so because they expect everyone else to do the same.**

Legitimacy is a phenomenon that naturally occurs in coordination games. If you are not in a coordination game, there is no reason to act according to your expectations about how others will act, and thus legitimacy is not important. But as we have seen, coordination games are everywhere in society, and therefore legitimacy proves to be quite important. In almost every environment where coordination games have existed long enough, mechanisms emerge that can choose the decision to be made. These mechanisms are powered by an established culture where everyone pays attention to these mechanisms and (generally) does what they say. Each person reasons that since *everyone* follows these mechanisms, if they do something different, they will only create conflicts and suffer, or at least be alone in a forked solitary ecosystem. If a mechanism succeeds in making these choices, then that mechanism has legitimacy.

In any context where a coordination game has existed long enough, there is likely a conception of legitimacy. **And blockchains are full of coordination games**. Which client software do you use? Which decentralized domain name registrar do you ask what address corresponds to an .eth name? Which copy of the Uniswap contract do you accept as "the" Uniswap exchange? Even NFTs are a coordination game. The two largest components of an NFT’s value are (i) the pride of owning the NFT and the ability to display your ownership, and (ii) the ability to sell it in the future. For both of these components, it is very important that any NFT you buy is recognized as *legitimate* by everyone else. In all these cases, there is a great advantage to having the same answer as everyone else, and the mechanism that determines that balance holds a lot of power.
