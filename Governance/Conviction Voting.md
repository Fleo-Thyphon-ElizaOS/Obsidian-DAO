**Conviction Voting** is a decision-making process that selects the aggregated preference of community members expressed continuously over time. Voters assert their preferences by allocating their votes to the proposals they wish to see approved. The longer a member stakes their votes on a proposal, the stronger the conviction becomes. Community members can change the proposals on which their votes are staked at any time, reflecting a total change in conviction. After sufficient conviction is reached, the proposal is adopted.

Time has several key impacts on the conviction voting method, which can be better understood using a water bucket analogy developed by Commons Stack. Suppose there are five proposals represented by buckets A, B, C, D, and E. When a voter wants to express an opinion on a proposal, they turn on their member preference tap and divert a portion of the flow into the bucket. Letâ€™s say they allocate 5% of the flow to proposal A, 0% to B, 20% to C, 30% to D, and 45% to E. Over time, the bucket will fill according to these proportions as the preference tap runs. If the voter later decides to reallocate from one proposal to another, say from 5% on A to 5% on B, the conviction for preference begins to degrade as if there were a hole at the bottom of bucket A.

Interestingly, the conviction voting method stems from a biomimetic approach to system design. Biomimicry is the emulation of systems found in nature to solve complex human problems. The design is understood as an analogy with how individual neurons trigger in the human brain. Action potential builds up over time until an action threshold is reached, and the neuron fires.

The continuous mechanism of conviction voting transforms vote buying, a potential concern in time-limited on-chain voting systems, into vote leasing. An attacker must continuously spend funds over long periods to successfully influence the outcome of a vote. This enhances the system's resilience against vote buying attacks and other forms of electoral collusion. Another advantage is that token holders with long-standing consistent opinions accumulate more conviction on a proposal, which helps reduce governance instability caused by the influx of new wealth into the DAO.
